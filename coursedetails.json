Over the years direct regulation of business by government has  been minimised, however, subtle control exists and at times, it makes all the difference. To keep a tab on the  powers of the government, it is e ssential to have an independent judiciary. Business managers fear getting  tangled up with lawyers, lobbyists, and bureaucrats, so they keep their distance from the government and legal  matters. This aversion leads many to neglect law as a competitive tool. Once they realise the importance of  being a part of rule making process, they try to influence rule making. Thus, they do the business the way they  like and still remain on the right side of law. The focus then is to use law as a potent tool in general an d as a  lethal weapon against competitors. Law, therefore, becomes the true friend, philosopher and guide. The course  examines the relationship between government, law and business and how businesses can use law to win  legally. The course is inspired by an d borrows a couple of chapters from the following two books: a) G. Richard Shell, Wharton:  Make the Rules or Your Rivals Will , Crown Business, NY, 2004 b) Constance E. Bagley, HBS:  Winning Legally , HBS Press, Boston, 2005 Course Objective:  - Provide the b usiness students an opportunity to understand the role of businesses in rule  making and how successful businesses  in most of the cases  make the rules for others. - To make the students realise the importance of the relationship of law and government and its  impact on business. - Make the students aware of the potency of legal tools, their use and limitations. Pedagogy:  Emphasis shall be on discussion of contemporary issues, which relate to all the three aspects of the course, viz.,  business, government and  law. As these issues are ultimately related to public in general, they generate greater  interest in the media. Both print and electronic media provide substantial information and insight into the current  issues. Besides the suggested text, it would be our  effort to cull relevant material of topical interest for class  discussion.  Brief  lectures  would  be  delivered  to  provide  an  overview  and  summarise  important  aspects. However,  the  course  relies  heavily  on  participation,  presentation  by  participants  and  the  e nsuing  class  discussion.  Number of sessions:  Total number of sessions is 2 0 Prerequisites and Eligibility, if any, and their Justification:  Basic principles of Business Law as taught in LAB  – Legal Aspects of Business.  Page  2 of  4 ,  BGL 201 5 June , Course Outline Relationship of the Course wit h the Overall Programme Objective and Related Courses: It is a general course which is relevant for all businesses and helps the business manager in reaching his goal in a  maze of government regulations and legal institutions.

The amount and  complexity of information produced in t he business world is increasing  at staggering rates. If this data is delivered  to you in spreadsheets or tabular re ports, it becomes very  challenging to find the pattern s, trends and correlations  necessary to perform your job well. Effective data visualization is an important tool in the decision making  process. It allows business decision makers to quickly examine large amounts of data, expose trends and issues  efficient ly, exchange ideas with key players, and influence the decisions that will ultimately lead to success. The goal of this course is to expose you to visual representation methods and techniques that increase the  understanding of complex data. In this course we will study good design practices for visualization, tools for  visualization of data from a vari ety of fields and visualization  software like Processing,  GapMinder and Table a u . Pre - requisites  Some exposure to programming. Evaluation Components The ev aluation is based on c lass participation  ( 5% ), up - to five small  individual  assignments spread throughout the  course (60%) and a final  group  project (35%). The group project will involve the use of a data visualization  software for investigating a substantial data - set of the student ’ s choice.

Each group is required to go through the following  articles as per the topic assigned to them  and prepare a PowerPoint presentation.  Group Number  Topic Assigned  1  “ Understanding Advertising Effectiveness from a Psyc hological  Perspective: The Importance of Attitudes and Attitu de Strength ”  from The SAGE Handbook of Advertising  2  “ Market Effects of Advertising  Intensity , Chapter 6” from  Effective Advertising  3  “ Advertising’s Dynamic and Content Effects , Chapter 7” from  Effective Advertising  4  “ Advertising as Persuasion , Chapter 8” from Effective Advertising  5  “ Argument in Advertising , Chapter 9” from Effective Advertising  6  “ Emotion in Advertising , Chapter 10” from Effective Advertising  2. The first article is available in the casemat and o thers are chapters of the book Effective  Advertising.  3. In order to illustrate the importance of concepts o n the assigned topic, the group should  include relevant examples from the advertising worl d/advertising clippings/cut-outs of print  ads/hoarding  pictures  etc.  in  their  presentation.  T he  groups  are  encouraged  to  meet  the  instructor with draft presentations before they mak e presentations in the class.  4. All Groups will be required to present the assigned  topic in class (time limit 20 minutes). The  presentation may be followed by short discussion on  the topic.    5. Group assignment has to be submitted on day of pres entation (11 th  September 2015) in the  form of hard copy of PowerPoint presentation only.  The printouts should be submitted at the  beginning of the class.  Thus, there is no need to submit a separate report .    7  Group Assignment 2  Assignment on Sales Promotion   Due Date for Product/Service Selection: 16 st  October 2015, Session 23  Due Date for Assignment Submission: 26 th  October 2015   General Guidelines:  1. Each group is required to select a product/service  from durable, non-durable or service  category. Example – Talcum powder, Toilet soaps, Co lor TV, Air conditioner, Credit cards,  Tour services etc. To avoid overlap of product/serv ice chosen, groups must e-mail their  product category choice by 16 st  October’ 2015.  2. In the chosen product category, the group needs to  compile consumer sales promotion offers  announced in last one year by few brands (at least  3) and prepare a master table presenting  content analysis of the offers which should contain  details about brand, type of promotion,  source of the advertisement giving offer, duration,  geographic scope, terms and conditions  etc. Please note that these parameters are indicati ve and you may add more based on your  analysis of promotions for the chosen product/servi ce category.   3. Select  a  brand  in  that  category  and  study  the  brand ’s  market  share,  positioning,  target  audiences aimed etc. through secondary sources and  in discussion within group.  4. Analyze the consumer sales promotion offers (at lea st two) in detail keeping in mind the  brand’s marketing, communication and sales promotio n objective, target audience aimed and  critical assessment of the design features.  5. Understand the perspectives of the company, channel  members and consumers for the chosen  brand through primary research.  6. Design  one  future  sales  promotion  scheme  for  the  ch osen  brand,  keeping  in  mind  the  understanding gained in points 4 and 5.   7. Each group needs to submit the soft copy of their r eports (maximum 10 pages) by 11.59.59  pm on 26 th  October’ 2015.   8. The  hard  copy  of  reports  can  be  submitted  on  27 th October’  2015.  No  PowerPoint  presentation is required . 8  Group Project  Marketing Communication Campaign for a chosen brand Due Date for Brand Selection: 26 th  October 2015   Due Date for Project Submission: 30 th  October 2015, Session 25-26  General Guidelines:  1. The objective of the project is to integrate advert ising and promotion elements of marketing  communication. It serves as a capstone project for  the entire course. For this project, think of  your group as an advertising agency which is compet ing for an important account in a  product/service  category  selected  by  the  group.  ( You  are  not  supposed  to  select  a  product/service  on  which  you  have  worked  for  FII  pr ojects. )  Prepare  marketing  communications strategy and campaign for a brand wi th justification (as if) to be presented to  the marketing team in the client organization.   2. Your group would be graded on two distinct parts of  the project.  The first part of the project  involves making a presentation in the class. The se cond part of the project would involve a  detailed report on your analysis and the recommenda tions.    3. Your detailed report should include the following c omponents:  • Situational Analysis: Description of the existing s ituation including company objectives,  company strengths and a detailed competitive analys is.  • Brief overview of segments, positioning and marketi ng strategy adopted for existing  brand.  • Understanding of the recent/past campaign. You need  to do a detailed analysis of the  communication objectives, message strategy, creativ e brief, advertising execution, budget  and media plan through primary and secondary resear ch.    • Develop a fresh marketing communication campaign fo r a chosen brand. (You may like  to design a storyboard for TVC, a sales promotion s cheme, online/mobile advertisement,  print  advertisement  or  a  radio  advertisement  and  an y  other  type  of  communication  vehicle that you wish to choose in an integrated ma nner.) Emphasis should be on creative  message design and creative execution with justific ation.  A final written report (in soft as well as hard cop y) must be submitted on the day of  presentation.    4. For each group, presentations will last for 20 minu tes followed by 5-7 minutes for questions  and discussion.  Each group is encouraged to discuss about the brand  with course coordinator before they  decide and convey their choice by 26 th  October 2015.  ","pdf":"term-5/ASPM-Course.pdf","summary":"2  III.

Bionics is not entirely a main - stream branch of science or technology and yet has been fairly visible due to its “p op - sci ence ” kind of references. It has been changing over the  ages with changing world - view of science. In Newtonian era , it had application related to  “making” of  tools/objects. With nature of complex system becoming more explicable,  this branch of study of Nat ure has  grown in every direction but it lacks a clear structure. This makes ‘teaching’ of bionics (more so as a small course) difficult, as giving it a fixed  structure  with  limited /defined  volume  of  information  defeats  the  entire  purpose  of  nurturing a tti tude for innovative thinking. Considering this, I do not find it meaningful to generate a very specific Bibliography or a  very comprehensively listed course material. I would rather respond dynamically to  interest areas of students as they emerge during c lass interactions. My  previous  experience  with  young  design  students  has  taught  me  that  a  lot  of  explorative and novel thinking emerges during the course of such discussio ns that can  be collective pursued. So, following is a basic frame around which I ho pe to create a newer form every time I  conduct the elective ! Samir Shukla  Format for a Course Outline  (As per IIM - A system) i. Course title BIONICS ii. Area to which the course belongs BIONICS is a recognized branch of knowledge belonging  broadly to science ii. a. A short description on the field of Bionics and its application Bionics has been traditionally defined as an applied branch of engineering emerging  from  Biology  +  Mechanics,  i.e.  M echanical  ideas/designs  inspired  from  Biological  structures or nature. Classical example of such an application is “Velcro”, the Hook and Loop fastener system  is a near copy of burrs (plant seeds that cling to animals). This is primary level of Bionic  ide a. Bionics still retains (and has actually acquired greater potential due to recent advances  in energy - efficient power systems and controlling devices) enough charm at this level. e.g. If student acquires curiosity and looks closer at an information triv ia like “Griffon  vulture’s  are  found  flying  at  40000  feet,  he  will  suddenly  encounter  presen ce  of  a  extremely high - end technology embedded in a vulture that can have huge economic  potential. BUT,  t he  subject  of my  interest  is  the  cotemporary  interpretatio n  of  Bionics  where  Natural  Structures  and  Systems  are  comprehended  to  generate  processes  and  application for use in real world;  e.g. evolutionary mechanisms vis - à - vis survival of a product/success of a decision. Or mating strategies vis - à - vis marketing s trategies Or  (at  very  operative  level  taking over of  a  lion  pride  vis - à - vis  hostile  take - over  in  corporate world Or (If you desire more “esoteric” relationships) Egg’s response to arrival of first sperm vis - à - vis arrival of a MNC in third world country  mar ket Behavior of a viral cells vis - à - vis behavior of terrorists’ cell Body - response to rash vis - à - vis mob behavior vis - à - vis emerging internet psyche The list is endless and endlessly curious.. So a pplications of Bionics are endless. There is no better model than Nature that can be  used to understand behavior of complex systems. My own orientation is towards using it  as a philosophical tool for having an alternate method for understanding behavior of  Reality. Be it market conditions or emerging f ashion trends, Bionics can help one look at  it from a new perspective. iii. Term in which the course is to be offered 0.50 unit (12 classes) iv. Instructor's name Samir Shukla v. Course objective T he primary  objective  of  this  course  is  to  make  a  person aware  of  an  alternate  methodology of understanding real world processes . Considering the wide and open - ended spectrum of knowledge Bionics encompasses,  I seek to encourage individuals to innovatively  identify novel and applicable concepts by  looking at natural processes.  vi. Type, plan and session - wise content of the course Lectures  inspiring  Group  Discussions  and  assignments  will  be  the  basic  method  of  conducting the course Sessio n wise content is provided bellow vii. Pedagogy The course is primarily divided into four phase: A. Introduction to natural world at “product” level, to create a curiosity base B. Inviting creative exploration to revisit the wonderful world of  science C. Looking at Nature as a rich source of “systems” D. Looking  for  a  comparable  non - natural  system  to  see  if  knowledge  can  be  synthesized by studying interrelationship between parts  (In between, at a suitable point, a much needed discussion is inserted  to discuss  nature as a source of “morality” to demystify bionics to prevent formation of an  image of nature (often mistaken with “god”)  as the sole or greatest source of  wisdom.) viii. Number  of  sessions  required,  hours  needed  per  s tudent  for  class  sessions, major papers/projects, etc. OUTLINE FOR A TWELVE SESSION COURSE (Session length:   65 minutes ) Session 1: INTRODUCTION TO PRIMARY LEVEL CONCEPTS OF BIONICS Lecture on traditional bionics, with a “preface” aimed at  destructio n of various popular  myths about nature. A small discussion on impact of “emotional myths” linked with  nature that clouds a purer understanding regarding workings of nature. The subject is soft - launched through an assignment requiring students to study ex isting  successful bionics products. Assignment 1: Identification of one example each by students and creation of small  presentation Session 2: UNDERSTANDING  THE  CONCEPT  OF  TRANSFER  OF  IDEA  FOR  ONE  DOMAIN TO OTHER AND ITS ADVANTAGES/LIMITATIONS Students present  their  assignments  in  class  leading  to  d iscussion  on  the  examples  identified by students to understand the “transfer of idea from nature to product” . Session 3: PRESENTATIONS + DISCUSSION Continuation of discussion from session 2  +  The discuss ion culminates at distribution of random examples from “Extreme Nature”, a  book full of trivia about nature (the longest, shortest, most poisonous, most stinky  etc.  kind of extreme examples from animal and plant world) that are handed out to students  to co me out with a presentation of their own idea about a nature inspired product (e.g.  Border fences made from forget - me - not hedge).  Session 4: PRESENTATIONS + DISCUSSION Presentation  of  Student  work  with  discussion  hinting  at  required  advancements  in  exist ing technology to convert the proposed solutions into reality. The  session  ends  with  discussion  regarding  “appropriateness”  in  using  nature  as  a  source for looking at solutions. Session 5: TAKING GOD OUT OF BIONICS  I have observed that due to  the theological nature of subject matter, believing young  minds tend to get carried away into start looking at Nature (product of God?) as a  perfect solution provider. A group discussion is held to question the seeming “perfectness” of natural world to  di spel the notion. The session ends with handing out of a small story based on wasp - spider study of Fabre to  start a discussion leading towards functioning of nature .  Web - link: http://samir - solongandthankyouforthefish.blogspot.in/search?updated - min=2008 - 01 - 01T00:00:00 - 08:00&updated - max=2009 - 01 - 01T00:00:00 - 08:00&max - results=1 Session 6: COMMENCING JOURNEY FROM PHILOSOPHY TO  NATURAL SYSTEMS A group discussion is held in class based on reading of the story that hints at difference  between human morality an d laws of nature i.e. difference between a “moral” god and  “natural” god. After  looking  at  the  philosophical  aspect  of  the  idea,  it  is  introduced  as  a  “natural  system” for governing i.e. a natural “product” and some musing is done on its possible  usefulne ss in future (e.g. in governing robot societies) The idea of nature as a source of functioning systems that can be studied to understand  prognosis of any type of system is introduced. Session7 - 8 : DISCUSSING EXAMPLES OF NATURAL SYSTEMS Talk is given on t he class’s preferred area of interest : Ranging from  Herd behavior to host - parasite relationship Evolution to  mechanism of vector - borne pathogens Emergence  of  “consciousness”  in  brain  to  Time  perception  in  various  types  of  ant  societies These two  session s are used to introduce the immense richness of natural world to  students by following their lead and developing them into meaningful relationships with  other non - natural systems. The second session ends with discussion on the final assignment expected fr om each  student as prime deliverable for the elective. Each student is expected to choose a “complex” (multi - element - ed) natural system and a  non - natural system to look for possible similarities that can be used for extrapolating  some meaningful insights  about the behavior of non - natural system.   Session 9: SUBJECT IDENTIFICATION  Each  student  presents  out - line  of  his/her  subject  for  verification  of  its  depth/meaningfulness as a subject to be studied further. Session is utilized to approve the subje ct chosen for study by each student. Session 10 - 11: FINAL PRESENTATIONS Each student presents in the class. Session 12: CONCLUDING LECTURE Subject is summed up by the faculty ix. Evaluation criteria (including pass/fail) Student will  be evaluated  in scale of 100  across the course on bases of assignments and  participation in group discussions as follows: Assignment 1:  Existing Bionics products Grades : 5 Assignment 2:   Creative product ideas Grades: 10 Assignment 5: Final present ation Grades:  40 Performance if Group Discussions: Grades: 45 Total  Grades: 100 Passing: 50 minimum x. Prerequisites and eligibility if any and their justification A  qualification  in  science  is  considered  mandatory  (B E,  B.Tech,  Doctors  etc.)  but  interested  student  without  qualification  is  allowed  to  approach  the  faculty  for  enrollment in the elective. Considering involvement o f scientific ideas and concepts, this  is required. xi. Restriction on class s ize (both minimum and maximum), if any, and  their justification Not less than 15 and not more than  40 .  As  elective will require personal interactions to develop ideas. xii. Relationship of the course with the overall programme objective a nd  related courses The course is oriented to be a “mind - opening course” and thus it will have  relevance in a  very fundamental way with over - all nurturing of a person..be it as a decision maker,  problem solver or just appreciating to wonderful complexity o f Nature.  xiii. Bibliography Subject  has  a  wide  base  and  thus  relevant  material  will  depend  on the  direction  a  student takes. There are a huge number of books related to various aspects of Bionics  that I would like to make a general list of, as follows: On Growth and Form: D’Arcy Thompson The Curves of Life: Theodore A.

WhileBitcoinasacurrency has had its ups and downs, there is growing interest in the decentralized ledger (the blockchain). The blockchain has potential applications in many diﬀerent areas of \fnance which have traditionally used a centralized ledger maintained by a trusted party. Banks, exchanges, depositories, central banks and regulators are all exploring potential applications of the blockchain to reduce costs, increase robustness and shorten settlement delays. A number of startups have received funding to build some of these applications. The course is intended to cover: \u000f The cryptographic foundations of the blockchain and related technologies \u000f The role of the ledger in payment systems, clearing and settlement systems, and the ineﬃciencies associated with the traditional centralized ledger \u000f The most important applications of the blockchain and the associated software solutions. The course is oriented towards \fnance professionals who need to understand the strategic implications of the blockchain in their respective \felds. While a high level understanding the cryptographic foundations is essential for this purpose, the course is not focused on the mathematical and technical aspects of the cryptography. Though the course is more about the blockchain than on Bitcoin, it takes the view that a study of the former must begin with an understanding of the latter. Apart from being the \frst application of the blockchain, the Bitcoin even now remains its most important exemplar. Pre-requisites The course tries to be self contained, but it assumes reasonable knowledge of basic \fnance, elementary mathematics and essential computing covered in the compulsory courses.

Income tax applies to all  individuals  and  corporate  persons  who  earn  income.  Excise  duty  applies  to  manufacturing of goods. Custom duty is levied when any person imports goods.  Value  Added  Tax  applies  t o  sale  of  goods.  Service  tax  applies  to  provision  of  services. Each of the taxes has a different basis. In addition, some taxes are applied  by the states, for example, VAT, while others are levied by the Centre.  Every stage of business or management prac tice involves incidence(s) of taxation.  Towards compliance with the requirements of the tax law, business practices have to  be optimally structured. Further, every contract or project has to be conceived with  incidences  of  taxation.  As  the  incidences  of  ta xation  change  every  year,  the  relationship of taxation and management practices have to be continually appraised.  Thus, it is imperative for a manager to be well versed with the foundation and  incidences of taxation in India. Objective The objective of  the course is to introduce the participants to the basis , incidence and  application of the main taxes in India, namely, income tax, excise, service tax and  Value Added Tax.

For emerging regions in particular, ICTs provide inexpensive means for  information  and  knowledge  dissemination  leading  to  over - all  improvement  in  living  stan dards. While governments around the developing world are in the process of adopting  digital technologies for progress, there is a huge role for the private sector to play, which is  currently largely unexplored.  This course will focus on how ICTs can be us ed to increase the quality of lives in emerging  regions,  in  a  sustainable  and  profitable  way.  We  will  explore  state - of - the - art  digital  technologies and appropriate business models to tap into this latent market.  We  will  critically  analyze  a  range  of  proje cts  to  provide  multiple  perspectives:  (1 )  the  entrepreneur’s lens of running a successful technolo gy venture in a rural setting (2 ) the  corporate lens of tappin g into the ICT BOP market and (3 ) the inventor’s lens of moving a  novel digital invention from t he lab to intended recipients in villages.  Among other things, we will examine:  How mobile penetration in rural areas is revolutionizing the banking industry.   One man’s crusade to provide a laptop to every school child across the world and  whether that r eally is such a good idea.  How a couple of MIT student’s leveraged local rural transport to provide data  connectivity to the remotest of regions.  Indian Tobacco Company (ITC)’s  eChoupal initiative that claims to have  revolutionalized supply - chains across  the country.

The amount and  complexity of information  produced in t he business world is increasing  at staggering rates. If this data is delivered  to you in spreadsheets or tabular re ports, it becomes very  challenging to find the patterns, trends and correlations  necessary to perform your job well. Effective d ata visualization is an important tool in the decision making  process. It allows business decision makers to quickly examine large amounts of data, expose trends and issues  efficiently, exchange ideas with key players, and influence the decisions that will ultimately lead to success. The goal of this course is to expose you to visual representation methods and techniques that increase the  understanding of complex data. In this course we will study good design practices for visualization, tools for  visualization of data from a vari ety of fields and visualization  software like Processing,  Mondrian , GapMinder and Table a u . Pre - requisites  Some exposure to programming. Evaluation Components The evaluation is based on c lass participation  ( 5% ), up - to fiv e small  individual  assignments spread throughout the  course (60%) and a final  group  project(35%). The group project will involve the use of a data visualization  software for investigating a substantial data - set of the student ’ s choice.

This encompasses those who (1) have an idea and want to assemble the human,  financial, technical and other resource to impl ement it (2) are likely to be key decision makers in  corporations and want to appreciate the challenges of entrepreneurship in the context of large firms and  (3) desire an entrepreneurial life style as a lifelong career option. The course will also be bene ficial for  students who might consider entrepreneurship at some time in the future. Course objectives are: 1. Identify the processes involved in starting a new venture 2. Identify the processes involved in funding and investing in a new venture or in growing an  existing one 3. Understand methods for organizing and managing an entrepreneurial venture  Understand methods for advising owners/managers of entrepreneurial ventures Description ENVP covers a wide canvas and adopts a broad view of entrepreneurship. It is organized around 4  modules.   Under the first module (Entrepreneurial Attributes) we will begin by investigating some of the common  myths surrounding entrepreneurship, identify th e risk and opportunities associated with new venture  creation and investigate the skills and attributes required to pursue an entrepreneurial career. We will then  examine the difference between an entrepreneurial and managerial mind - set across a range of d imensions.   The next module (Entrepreneurial Teams and Plans) examines entrepreneurship as a team activity  involving planning. In this students will be walked through, and taught how to critique, a business plan.  They will also be expected to write a mini - version of one as their end term assignment (details in next  section). We will engage with opportunity recognition behavior and understand how entrepreneurs  observe patterns that help them connect the dots. Utilizing an effectual lens we will appreciate h ow  entrepreneurs often take decisions based on three fundamental questions - who they are/ what they  know/whom they know. The importance of social networks, and entrepreneurs' weak and strong ties will  be emphasized as also their preference for leveraging O PR  (other peoples resources).  Students will use a  POCD (people/opportunity/context/deal) framework to evaluate opportunities  The third module (Entrepreneurial Business Models) examines franchising, acquisition and crowdfunding   and various methods of ra ising funds. In the realm of venture financing we will investigate the nature and  availability of early stage venture capital and how VC's create value and some of their limitations that  have persuaded many entrepreneurs to keep them at an arms distance. S tudents will also become familiar  with business models that have leveraged technology to transform traditional industry. The concluding module (Entrepreneurial Context) begins by examining the lean start - up culture that  favors experimentation over elaborat e planning. Innovation and creative thinking will be emphasized as  also understanding the dotcom boom/bust and its impact on new ventures creation. With research  indicating that 75% of start - ups fail 1 , we will understand entrepreneurial failure and it abil ity to serve as a  learning tool for the entrepreneur. This engagement with failure will be a central theme through the  course. The challenges that large firms face both in facilitating an entrepreneurial culture and in  assimilating more nimble start - ups wi ll be analyzed. We will also examine the concept of a search fund  that has become popular among those who have a desire for entrepreneurship but lack a business idea to  pursue. The course will conclude by making the students question whether their desire i s for  entrepreneurship or merely an entrepreneurial career. Both offer interesting possibilities Pedagogy The course will be delivered with a mix of case discussions, lectures and guest speakers. Students must be  prepared to (1) read the case and readings in advance of the class (2) actively participate in class  discussion and (3) challenge assumptions and models.  Guest speakers have been planned for this course. Depending on th eir availability case dates may be  change d. Students will be advised in advanc e about this.  Evaluation No Component Weightage 1 Class Presence and Participation 20 % (individual) 2 Case written analysis & home work 40 % (individual) 3 Business Plan - External judges 35%(group) 4 Business Plan - Peer evaluation 5%  (group) Students  are expected to be present and well prepared for every class. Assignment questions are listed at the  end of each case. Besides these the instructor may raise additional questions. Remember class participation is  not only having a voice but, more importantl y, raising quality issues relevant to the case. Class participation  will also be evaluated in terms of interaction with guest speakers during their question and answer sessions.  In case you have any hesitation/ concerns kindly approach the instructor at th e start of the term so that he can  facilitate your participation with prior planning.  At the end of some cases a turn - in home work will be announced. This will be graded. In case the instructor  feels the class is not well prepared a short quiz maybe given  at the beginning of class.  A plan will be due at the end of the term. Students need to from groups of four for this assignment. The  business plan is not an overnight effort and must be worked on through the term. The cases selected for the  course cover a wide variety of contexts/industries. While reviewing these cases students should keep updating  their own business plan with thoughts/ideas that emerge. A business plan written overnight will be reflected  in mediocre work.  1 Ghosh,\tS.\tHarvard\tBusiness\tSchool\tlead\tauthor\tof\tthe\tstudy\tconcludes\t\"VC's\tbury\ttheir\tdead\tvery\t quietly.\t They\temphasize\ttheir\tsuccesses\tbut\tdon't\ttalk\tabout\ttheir\tfailures\tat\tall\" At the end of week 2 students are expected to inform the AA on the topic of the business plan they intend  pursuing and the names of other member of their group.

The course is designed on the assumption  that  a person  requires time, space and  someone with whom  he/she can reflect on the  journey of  their life . The course facilitates  e xplor ation of the meaning an individual a scribes to ones’ life experiences .   It is assumed that it is possible to  find alternative  meanings and free oneself from habitual ways of looking and meaning making.  This  process of sensemaking  enables one to explore alternative  relevant  ways to  relat e to the  world.  As we explore ourselves we also learn to relate and examine our relationships with  o thers.  This process helps us understand issues about working and living in a more  integrated and authentic manner. We will focus on g roup processes  – becomin g aware  of and understanding one’s ability to contribute to growth & performance of the group  and deal with personal issues of authority, dependence & counter - dependence. The  ERI  creates  a  space,  a  setting  and  a  time  for  the  individual to  ask  some  basic  p hilosophical questions as to  –  W ho am I?   Where do I come from?  What is the purpose and meaning of  my  life ?  How do I relate to the world and people ?  H ow do I give shape to my own life an d what do I offer to the world? The focus  of this course  is  also  o n relating to the self and  others .  Thus, we would  continuously examine the i mpact of my behavior on others and that of others on me and  my ability to cope with various situations that life might bring to light for me. M ethodology Methodology  is  participative  and  exploratory.  No  solutions  or  specific  answers  are  given. Each participant is  invited to share whatever aspects of the journey of life and  relationships which he/she  wishes to share. There are no compulsions for specificitie s  of sharing. There is only  an  invitation which an individual gives himself/herself for  sharing and reflect ion .  There is also focus on s pecific emotions/ feelings with the awareness that these are  distinct  from  thoughts .  It  is  believed  that  a  number  of  i nsights  are  developed  in  response to the experience during the course in the ‘Here & Now’. As a participant you  would be invited to be aware and mindful at all times of the here and now. The role of the faculty is to facilitate explorations and reflection s.   The schedule of the program is attached.   Each participant will be required to schedule  personal reflection  time  before  and /or after class.  We believe that reflection  is  an  important aspect of learning. Assignment The experience is not graded.  There are  three  assignments which would be graded .  1. A n individual log book of reflection for each day  ( 4 0%) 2. An autobiography relating to the learning, concepts and theoretical frameworks  reflected in the ERI experience  ( 6 0%) ASSIGNMENT I ( 4 0 percent) Thi s is an individual assignment. There are five days of log book. Every morning before  you come to session you are to write down the previous day ’ s experience and your  reflections .  These are some of questions that you might use to help you reflect.  What  questions did you begin the ERI journey with? Where are you vis - à - vis the  questions?  How did you experience yourself in the Lab? What notions about yourself have  been reinforced or modified? What new discoveries if any have you made about  yourself     What  happened? What did you discover about yourself?  In what ways has your worldview been reinforced or modified by this  experience?  What are the significant processes that you have observed at the  group/community levels?  What in your view are some of the signi ficant issues/dilemmas of living in  today’s world?  What structures of thought and feeling have you created for yourself? How do  these impact your meaning making and choice making?  What new beginnings if any have you made? How would you like to carry it  for ward? This reflection log maybe in prose, poetry, drama or painting.  You may need to decode  an abstract form to some extent for the faculty to understand your reflection. The reflection log needs to be submitted before you leave  Dasada to your  respectiv e faculty facilitator s . ASSIGNMENT  II ( 6 0 percent) An autobiography relating to the learning, concepts and  experience reflected in the ERI.   This autobiography must be written only  two weeks after the ERI experience.  The last  section of your autobiograph y may also include your thoughts for the future. Submissions will be made on  email . You are also expected to read some books that are  highly reflective of personal journeys and growth in preparation for writing the  autobiography. A section of the  autobiography must include lessons you draw from such  masters. We will also give you some reading during the course or after the completion of the  course.  You may wish to integrate insights from those into your autobiography. A Preliminary  (Tentative)  List of Suggested Books to Read  1. Notes to Myself  - Hugh Prather 2. The Road Less Traveled  – M.

The objective of the course is to give participants  a hands - on experience of real - life  applications  through analysis of interesting data sets.  So that at  the end of the  course the  participants may feel confident about modeling tim e series data  mainly for forecasting purpose. The theoretical concepts like covariance stationary process, stationary ARMA processes, some  specific unit root processes e.g. ARIMA models and  its  variations, and models with conditional  heteroskedasticity  (ARCH and GARCH) will be explained  through analysis of data . Forecasting  the demand of new product is often a problem for an organization. An interesting HBR case will  be used to explain such a forecasting process.  The course ends with the presentation of  projects.   Pre requisites There is no prerequisite but a prior interest in the subject would definitely help.

Books for Change,  Bangalore Annexure 1 Detailed course objectives Harsh Mander \\ IIM 10 Since the 1990s, concerns with governance have been suddenly thrust into the vocal centre - stage of  the  mainstre am  international  development  debate.  The  belief  in  the  critical  role  of  a  strong  interventionist state is not new; it has been central, although often in contrasting ways, to the world - view of both Keynesian and Marxist political economists through the gre ater part of the twentieth  century, whether to address in various ways market failures, to ensure redistributive justice, or to drive  economic growth.  However, the contemporary paradigm of good governance has distinct ideological  sources from these major  streams. It is derived from the neo - liberal project of structural adjustment.   This paradigm stresses that governance is far more than just government, and includes within its ambit  also the private sector and civil society.  Its major point of departure i s that it regards the role of the  state primarily to act “not as a direct provider of growth but as a partner, catalyst, and facilitator” .  (The  World Bank 1997:1) It continues to acknowledge the centrality of the state to economic and social  development, b ut stresses that this does not mean that development has to be state provided. Instead,  it sees the state not as a direct provider of growth but as a partner, catalyst, and facilitator. There is no doubt that the quality of governance has critical bearing on the lives and future of the poor.  Yet there is evidence that most of the contemporary pressure for good governance is being driven not  by  the  critical  survival  needs  of  the  poor  but  by  trans - national  corporate  aspirations  for  a  more  predictable playing field as they negotiate  an increasingly globalised economy. This  module will  attempt to examine more carefully this dominant neo - liberal paradigm of ‘good governance’, and  critically  analyze its implications for poor people.  It will also suggest some ele ments, or building  blocks, of an alternative paradigm.  It will demonstrate that it is critically important that this agenda for good governance is reclaimed by  poor and  marginalized people, from their perspective, to serve their needs, to meet their aspi rations, to  address their ends of greater equity and justice. It may be useful, if only to distance oneself from the  mainstream agenda of good governance, to speak instead of humane, just and equitable governance, of  which the foundations are not rule of l aw but justice, not a retreating state but an activist strong state,  and powerful  organizations of poor and  marginalized people to hold governments responsive and  accountable to them. The  course  will  introduce  students  to  debates  around  poverty,  marginali zation,  social  exclusion,  development, public policy, law and the role of the state, with special reference to the experience of  India. India in particular, produces diverse experiences of marginalization, impoverishment and social  exclusion. This course w ill focus on the effects of law and public policy on the lives of intensely  marginalized people. How does the postcolonial state invisibilise, illegalize, criminalize or custodialise  people who are most vulnerable and powerless? How do disenfranchised peop les contend with the  extremely difficult circumstances of their lives? These concerns will be explored in the context of  contemporary India, focusing on dali t s, women, the urban homeless and street children, and people  who  live  with  hunger  etc .  We  will  uti lize  case  studies,  film,  law  and  policy  documents,  critical  analyses,  and  first  person  narratives  to  make  visible  these  complex  dynamics  of  oppression  and  resistance. What alliances and forms of thought might result from socially engaged scholarship in  int imate relation to struggles for life, dignity, and justice? The course will also introduce researchers to qualitative research methodologies, which will enable  them to directly observe, with empathy and respect, the experience of impoverishment, discrimin ation  and acute deprivation, but also ways that people cope, with courage, humanity and dignity. Annexure 2 Assignments Each student will undertake 2 assignments, in lieu of an end - of - course examination.  Harsh Mander \\ IIM 11 Assignment 1:  (60 marks) Each  student  will  ident ify  one  woman,  man  or  child  living  in  conditions  of  poverty  and  social  exclusion. They may be homeless, disabled, single women, impoverished working women, street or  other out of school children, survivors of violence, persons persecuted and discriminated  because of  their caste or religious identity, or others. They may or may not be residents of Ahmedabad. (Please do  not include for this any staff or contract worker of IIMA). The student will spend as much individual time as possible with this person, base d on the person’s  consent, and try to build a relationship. They will hear their stories, but also accompany them to their  homes and work locations. They will then record their life histories in the form of a narrative, which  may be 3000 words or longer. T hey can optionally also add photographs of other visual materials.  Selected assignments will be presented to the full class.  Assignment 2  (30 marks) Each student will undertake one of the following projects: 1. Equity and Growth:  Please critically review t he proposals made by Amartya Sen and Jean  Dreze in ‘An Uncertain Glory’ for simultaneously ensuring economic growth and equity, and  comment on Sen’s critics like Jagdish Bhagwati. 2. Stories of Marginalised Persons: In Unheard Voices, as well as the GGPLP co urse reader given  to the students, there are a number of real life stories of marginalised persons.  In the light of a  selection of at least 5 of these stories, please critically review the role  – positive and negative  - of  public  policy  and  the  law  in  cre ating,  maintaining  or  changing  conditions  of  social  and  economic marginalisation. 3.

The  recent  slowdown seems  to  reveal  some  weaknesses in the model itself .  Furthermore , the growth is not inclusive enough. In  every sector of Indian economy, there is a s cope of innovation to make the development  process  more  creative,  innovative  and  inclusive.  This  course  is  not  about  just  understanding where we stand. It is about creating scenarios to reach where India is  poised to be. There are several questions that th e world expects India to answer. How  would  children  be  educated  so  that  they  would  discharge  the  responsibilities  of  a  developed nation ? Will Indian model of development be a replica of the western model or  will it have some unique  Indian  characteristics? What will be the relationship between  state,  industry (public  and  private) and  civil  society  during  the  transition  and  afterwards? The vision of India 2020 may need to be looked at afresh in the light of  challenges that growth impulses are throwing up. The increasing aspirations of socially  disadvantaged groups have to be accommodated in a peaceful and cooperative manner.  But, social cleavages in several parts of the country require new ways of dealing with  disquiet and dissent. Apart from looking at the  competing scenarios, the  participants are also expected in this  course to create disruptive innovative pathways of progress within the country and  internationally.  Why  does  a  society  learn  to  live  almost  indefinitely  with  ‘wicked  problems’, or persistent s ocial unsolved problems   dealing with public hygiene, mass  illiteracy,  drinking  water,  child  labour,  malnourishment  among  children,  or  women  safety?  Large  number of less or least developed countries looks up to India for building  their  capacity.  Can  India create  a  pool  of  open  source  innovations  in  governance,  technologies  and  infrastructure  development,  which  can  be  shared  widely? The  innovations by common people provide a tremendous opportunity for improving the  quality of life of millions of people with in the country and outside. In many cases, these  innovations in informal sector complement the innovations in  the  formal sector. The  role of science and technology in India has been very pivotal and yet the best students  do not go for a career in science a nd technology any more.  How do we make the  strategic  sectors  of  Indian  economy  attract  the  best  minds  with  passion  for  pursuing  India's progress? The relationship of India with its neighbours an d other super powers requires a new  approach. There has  been a perceptible change in the importance India attaches to its  neighboring countries with the change in the government.  What  are the new policy and  strategic  choices  in this regard and how Indian economic, social and cultural diversity  would influence  these choices? Can an economically developed country live in peace  with  lesser - developed neighbours without  making  them  a  part  in  its  own  growth  trajectory ?  Some  of  these less  economically  developed  countries in  the  region  are  actually  nebulous economies, a  kind of pre - emerging countries. One of the important gaps in the entire planning process is to rely only on GDP as the  index  of  development.  In  this  course,  students  will  try  to  develop  NPI  (National  Prosperity Index or National Happiness Index as attem pted by Bhutan ), which will look  at not just the stocks and the flow of goods and services, but also of various tangible and  intangible changes in the quality of life , wellbeing and the environment. This might help  in evolving a true index of national pros perity and  well - being . The paradox of high  Seminar course on Globalising and Resurgent Indi a through Innovative Transformation (GRIT) 2 growth of GDP not reflecting the large scale deprivation or dissatisfaction will have to be  resolved. There is also a crisis of leadership. The  participants  may like to  learn how to develop  visions for taking t he country forward, create commitment around these visions among  the  parliamentarians  and  then  selling  these  policy  perspectives  to  the  concerned  Ministry or the  cabinet.  It  is  hoped  that  some  of  the  policy  scenarios  evolved  by  the  participants will  be  d iscussed with the  concerned  ministr ies  and once these get accepted,  further policy  advocacy  will be  pursued.   On some other policies, which cut across various ministries,  feedback will be sought from  a group of MPs across party lines to take the ideas forw ard.  Analysis  will  be  done  of  why  certain  policy  changes  fail  to  take  off  so  that  failure  management  is  learnt  as  carefully  as  managing  the  success.  Participants  will  also  develop strategies to achieve success in various initiatives such as PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas); provision for  mental  work and not  menial work in  employment  guarantee  programmes;  converting  the  whole  country  into  a  literate  society  within  ten  years;  halving  the  dropout  rate  of  students  within  five  years  at  secondary l evel (from 60 to 30 per cent) and eliminating it in ten years; removing  corruption in everyday life in at least ten most frequent public - private interactions,  including cultural and craft skills within the scope of skill development policies,  etc. Reflect ion on what can India learn from successes and failures of European and other  countries  in  social,  economic,  cultural,  environmental  and  intellectual  property  protection policies, enrich the discussion in the class.  Pedagogy: After initial lecture s on f ramework for analyzing public polices ,  participants  will be  expected to submit project proposals/ synopsis for creating scenarios based on multiple  and if necessary, contending options for specific pol icy and institutional changes .  They  will be expected to review key innovations around the world in that sector or sub sector  ( marks 20 % ).  The project teams would be enabled to consult the subject matter specialists. The final  reports will be presented in open sessions in which other faculty members and the students may also be invited to ask questions and make comments. The reports will be  revised and those of them, which are of outstanding quality, may be published for wider  debate. Prof.  A P J Abdul  Kalam will be happy to comment on the  selected  projects du ring  presentation on No vember 19, 2014 and respond to queries by email  where necessary.   I n case  the course  participants would like to meet him in Delhi for guidance in their  project work during the  course that can also be  facilitated .  All the GRI I T pa rticipants  should define their project ideas around  a specific public policy affecting agricultural,  industrial,  environmental,  social sectors [health, education, women welfare, child care,  expanding  opportunities  for  physically  challenged  people,  etc.]  en ergy,  corruption,  infrastructure, innovations, etc.  Participants may keep in mind following ten pillars  visualized by Prof. Kalam while developing their ideas. 1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide  has reduced to a thin line. 2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate access  to  energy and quality water. 3 3. A Nation where agriculture, industry and service se ctor work together in  symphony. 4. A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any  meritorious candidates because of societal or economic discrimination. 5. A Nation, which is the best destination for the most talented scho lars,  scientists and investors. 6. Nation where the best of h ealth care is available to all. 7. A Nation where the governance is responsive, transparent and c orruption  free. 8. A Nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiteracy removed and  crimes against women and children are absent and none  in the society feels  alienated 9. A Nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, devoid of terrorism, peaceful  and  happy and continues with a sustainable growth path. 10. A Nation that is one of the best places to live in a nd is proud of its  leadership. The participants will also prepare a country profile from Indian eyes.  Each student will  make a profile of a country fro m any region and trace Indian linkages, strategic interest  and the grounds on which relationship with that country can be leveraged  (25 marks ). The focus of the course is on making a difference.   Recall five characters from history,  contemporary polity, l iterature or otherwise which have inspired you to being about  change in society at different scales.  It is also proposed to bring out a book based on  contributions in the past GRI I T courses and current year projects.  Specific meetings will  be arranged wit h the policy makers wherever necessary to make the ideas more  concrete and implementable.

Introduction : The past five centuries have been momentous in the world of business and commerce. In  1500, the centre of gravity of world business was firmly located between the Indian  Ocean World and the Mediterranean Basin. Over the next five hundred years, the locus  shifted to Western Europe and North America. Why and how did this happen? Who were  the key actors behin d these changes? What type of firms and business practices emerged  across the world? This course addresses these questions and enables one to understand  the evolution of firms, industries and economies over the long run.  Understanding  seismic  shifts  of  t he  past  broadens  the  horizon  of  the  management  professional and provides skills to better understand the future.  The course is divided in four parts. Part 1 provides overviews of three global revolutions - scientific,  imperial  and  industrial  – that  gave  birth  to  the  modern  world  and  its  interconnections with business and economic history. Part 2 reviews key actors in  global  business history. Part 3 highlights the origins of business practices by considering the  histories of specific firms and sectors. Against the backdrop of the global revolutions, key  actors and business practices, Part 4 traces the business and econo mic histories of regions  across the world in comparative perspective.  Part 1: Global Revolutions, 1500 - 2000: Introduction,  The  Scientific  Revolution,  The  Imperial  Revolution,  The  Industrial  Revolution Part 2: People: Merchants, Entrepreneurs, Managers , Labourers, Women Part 3: Firms and Business Practices: The Joint Stock Firm (English East India Company), Modern Management (Railroad  Companies), Mass Production & Marketing (Ford and General Motors), Big Business - Mergers & Acquisitions, Modern Finance (Lehman Brothers) Part 4: Regions: US, UK, Germany & Japan; China and India; Russia and Europe; Africa and the Middle  East; Latin America, East Asia and Rest of the World PGP - FABM PGPX FPM # of students viii. Objective :  To  understand  the  evolution  of  modern  business and  economies in  globa l  perspective   To comprehend the global revolutions, actors, business practices and regional  business and economic  histories across five centuries  viii. Pedagogy : The course will be taught through interactive sessions with class room discussions, group  exercises and presentations.

International Exchange students to PGP are welcome. Diversity in class  and learning by doing would be emphasized through one individual assignment and one  group project.   INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT: INTERNATION A L BUSINESS Pick  any country (provided no one else has chosen it before you!) and using publicly  available data from databases in the library and other information of relevance,  study the  country risk and political risk in that country using the framework discussed in class .  Consider in the context of a greenfield  foreign direct investment by your firm in a fully  owned  new  subsidiary company there which would own and operate a  manufacturing facility  for making technology intensive  prod ucts ( on which you hold a patent ) for sales in that  country and exports from that country . GROUP  PROJECT: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS  I  Objectives The aim of the group project work is (a) to provide opportunities to deepen your learning in this course th rough independent work as  a group on a theme you consider worth pursuing,  and, 9 (b) to enable all groups to learn from each other through the work presented and discussed in  class. Key Datelines : Announcement of  chosen Individual Assignment Country (F irst come first accepted) and Group  Project : By 23.9.2015 (by email to  anmathur@iimahd.ernet.in and  malayp@iimahd.ernet.in i dentifying the Group Coordinator.  Maximum 4 persons to a group; Minimum 2 - 3 persons in a  group. No change to topic or group composition is possible after that. You may begin working on your individual assignment country as soon as the AA confirms this  to you . Project Report ( softcopy in  RTF or WORD + hardcopy ):  to be submitted to a mutually agreed  date and time which must be  b efore  the  beginning  of session  23 (Text to be limited to an upper limit of 8000 words around 32 pages double spacing,  including references which should be fu lly cited as per IIMA citation guidelines and a  maximum of 10 pages of exhibit/graphs/statistical tables/annexures) Group Presentations and Discussions:  soft copies of ppt by email and hard copy 3 sli d es to a  page by beginning of session  24. II   Project Work Each group may pick  any one from three possibilities and decide on their topic : A. Choose any business firm  or registered organisation  (a firm  or organisation  you are  familiar with) , not a Group of Companies, and examine how the firm  or  organisation  can gain more from the design of and participation in international value chains  beyond what the firm  or organisation  has done. For example, you may like to evaluate  the international footprint and propose something new. Or you may like to pro pose  opportunities for foreign commercial presence, a mode of entry for products/services  to be made or procured or marketed there or joint ventures or strategic alliances or  M&A or any/all of these. Whatever you propose, you should clearly present rationa le  for your choice.

Ankur Parekh Office: Tel:  ankurparekh @iimahd.ernet.in Course Objective:  Enterprises, the world over, now  conduct business on a dramatically more international scale, which results in  trans - border disputes and conflict of laws. Speedy resolution of business disputes is imperative to prevent  diffusion of corporate resources in avoidable litigation, which is not orious globally for costing a lot in terms of  both time and money. In certain jurisdictions the situation is reaching a standstill. Business leaders should spend  more time on their business rather than in courts of law. It is precisely because of this reas on they need to know  the methods of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)  – arbitration, conciliation, mediation, negotiation and a  mix  of  these.  One  method  of  choice  for  settlement  of  business  disputes  is  the  ‘international  commercial  arbitration’, which i s popular all over the world and has stood the test of the time.

Introduction : Course content : The Indian economy has gone through several phases and regime changes in the  post - independence period and these have influenced the politics and society as much as social  and political forces have affected both policy and the resulting economic development s.  The similarities and contrasts with the East Asian industrialisations are most rewarding in  any attempt to build policy options for the future. Unlike many other societies India’s  development was forged in a democratic framework, so the drivers from pol itics and social  movements cannot be overstressed in relation to the role of strategy and plans. Caste,  religion, class besides language and region do define identity and grouping for political  mobilisation to influence especially economic policies in a wa y that is uniquely complex. The reforms of the Indian economy initiated by the Narashima Rao government fostered  dramatic change and bringing forth a major role for markets and enhancing the growth  rates. However they were not sustained over the longer te rm since inter alia the second  generation  reforms  in  the  more  difficult  aspects  covering  subsidies,  infrastructure  regulation, land, social policies, education and public health have proven difficult for  Indian policy makers.  Unlike many other economies, given the vast social diversity and income - inequality and  inherited  social  discrimination  in  the  form  of  caste,  and  perhaps  even  because  of  an  administration that emerged out of alien rule, the challenges that the state has to overcome  to lead to the econ omic and social transformation of the country are many.  In this course wherever the comparative perspective is important  – East Asian countries  including China are typically the ones to which India would be compared and contrasted.  The course would in detail trace the developments since the reforms of 1991 - 92,  1992 - 93  PGP - FABM PGPX FPM # of students Yes Yes Yes and the colonial and early post - independence developments would provide the backdrop.  The focus would be on current issues.  The course besides bringing out the current issues and challenges in policy, provides a  background to the reform process an d also develops minimally some of core concepts in  development economics, political science and sociology . viii. Objective : The objective of the course is to familiarise the student with key features of the Indian  economy and society. The course is especially useful to those with a deep interest in India  and its future.  viii. Pedagogy : Lectures and discussions would be the principal mode of instruction. In some sessions  cases may also be used. ix. Evaluation Scheme :  Class participation would carry 25% weight,  and a group assignment 75% Topics for assignment would be on aspects of the Indian economy and society and could  involve the reading of a book or a set of articles that furthers the student’s understanding  of a particular topic or issue of current importan ce. Note: i. Weightage for CP should not exceed 20 per cent which includes  weightage for attendance not more than 10 per cent. ii. The weightage of components related to individual assessment shall not  be less than 50%. iii.   There will be minimum three evaluation components for any core or  elective course having credit of 1 or more. x.

ITS  is  seen  as  an  effective  way  of  managing  transportation networks with a twin objective of resource productivity and  effective response time. It is considered to the futuristic guiding approach  for  service  providers  to  en sure  exceptionally  high  quality  service  to  the  commuters.  ITS  is  multidisciplinary,  with  dominance  of  technology.  The  standards  related  to  design,  project  management,  operations  and  maintenance  are  evolving.  Needless  to  emphasis,  they  are  complex  and  chal lenging.  ITS  requires a supporting policy environment of the state. Investments required  are huge, hence there is a need to articulate a business case. The life cycle of  ITS  include s conceptualization,  design,  project  management,  operations,  maintenance an d enhancements.  This course  attempts  to  provide  an  overview  of  several  aspects  related  to  ITS.

Instructor: Premchander, Faculty Block Wing # 6 Tel: Off, (6632) 4857; e - mail: premc@iimahd.ernet.in 1) What the course is about? The course is about possibly the most exciting and complex phenomenon impacting the global economic landscape. An M&A (mergers and acquisitions) or a restructuring transaction such as the failed Apollo - Cooper 2013; Arcelor - Mittal formation in 2006 or a Bh arti Airtel - MTN combination tends to enjoy high profile media coverage, far beyond the underlying industrial or bu siness logic. At the moment Berk shire Hathway is undertaking $32 b takeover of P recision Castparts (An Aerospace supplier) bucking recent tren ds. Beneath the veneer of hype and hoopla and the facade of shareholder value, strategic compulsions, financial wizardry, legal acrobatics, organisational dilemmas, plain clash of giant CEO egos and old style politics - all play themselves out. This course s eeks to offer a comprehensive and in - depth treatment into this multi - faceted phenomenon - something which would figure at the top of any CEO’s agenda. The course is NOT a pure finance course, nor does it claim to offer new fundamental knowledge or concepts. Rather it is a multi - functional course, seeking to help develop and garner insights and perspectives in a variety of M&A and restructuring situations spanning different industries, competitive environments and regulatory regimes, building essentially on th e already familiar concepts and tools. The prospective course registrants are expected to be comfortable in dealing with the “softer” strategic and organisational issues and different shades of grey, and not just the valuation or financing aspects of deal making. 2) Introduction It is widely recognised that any growth - seeking company would have to embrace the M&A (mergers and acquisitions) route to corporate development at some stage in its corporate life cycle. This is indeed so despite the none - too - inspiring track record of success in M&A. Most empirical studies indicate that only about a quarter to a third of the M&A transactions could be termed successful in creating value, the avowed goal of every deal. Yet the global M&A transactions remain a multi - trill ion dollar business, though with sharp year - on - year variations mirroring the broader economic and technological trends. Besides seeking growth through M&A, companies across the world also pursue the opposite — contraction through divestiture and de - merger (s pin - off) as they constantly endeavour to realign and rebalance their business portfolios and refocus their energies and resources. A severe downturn, like the one the global economy has been going through for some time now, imposes only additional pressure on companies to restructure — to achieve lighter balance sheets, simpler organisation and leaner business portfolios. Indian environment, relatively placid historically, is no more impervious to this restructuring trend as Indian companies also rework their growth strategies to achieve superior market position and greater global presence. Given the sheer sweep of the restructuring phenomenon, most of us also tend to be impacted by these forces, be it as investors or investment bankers, or as employees of the companies involved, or as members of the society at large. It is equally important to understand the key macro - economic and firm - level forces driving the restructuring initiatives at individual companies that could eventually lead to massive structural tr ansformation of industries and even economies at large. It is in this setting that the course on Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructuring (MACR) is being offered as an elective. The course, as indicated earlier, would seek to capture the multi - d imensional -- strategic, financial, organisational, human and legal -- facets of this complex phenomenon. While it is acknowledged that the restructuring phenomenon could be studied from a variety of perspectives such as those of the industrial and financial economists or of the behavioural scientist, the focus of this course is firm - oriented and the view poin t predominantly managerial. Creation and sustenance of shareholder value is the central theme that runs through the course. Consistent with this theme, the course seeks to offer useful insights into and help develop broad perspectives on such issues of con temporary relevance as linkage between corporate strategy, financial policy and shareholder value, company/business valuation and corporate governance dimensions of restructuring transactions. 3) Course Objectives: The possible takeaways from the MACR cours e include the following: a) Familiarity with different types of restructuring transactions - both business combination and break - up transactions (such as merger, acquisition, LBO, de - merger, divestiture etc.) and their rationale. b) Enhanced understanding of corporate growth and renewal strategies - expansion, diversification and shrinkage - through mergers acquisitions and divestments. (Motives) c) Sharper insights into the process of value creation by firms and businesses, and to the sources of the value. d) Str onger analytical foundations for evaluating the impact of corporate strategic decisions on shareholder value. e) Better appreciation of the importance of organisational process issues such as pre - transaction planning, deal execution and post - merger integration. f) Broad awareness of the applicable legal, tax and capital market issues and their implications for deal structuring. g) Some exposure to the working of the market for corporate control and corporate governance dimensions of corporate restructuring. 4) Course Pedagogy Pedagogy would include analysis of, and in - depth discussions involving a number of cases, faculty - presentations and discussions and student assignments. The cases/faculty presentations will examine strategic restructuring and repositioning strategies bot h in the Indian as well as international contexts exposing the participants to transactions in a variety of industries, economic, regulatory environments and strategic contexts. Detailed session - wise outline is given later in this outline. 5) Evaluation: Evaluation is based on class preparation and meaningful participation, student presentation and examinations with the following indicative weights for the various components. a) Attendance and Class participation (CP) 15% b) Group Assignments 1 /In - class quizzes 25% c) Negotiations Exercise (group) 20% d) End - term examination 40% 1 Two group assignments are to be submitted (each 10% weight). The assignments are due on October 29 and November 19. T here is also a group project in the form of M&A negotiation exercise. The course faculty would form and announce groups for the purpose in good time and circulate detailed guidelines for the negotiation exercise. 6) Detailed Sessions Plan Session - wise details are given below.

K. Sinha, Wing 10, Phone: 4892 Academic Associate :  Introduction Consumer shop from different channels based on the values that they derive from each of the  formats.  Stores  formats  are  chosen  based  on  availability,  accessibility,  ambience  and  affordability. It also depends on the cost of shopping tasks. It is found that consumers tend to  choose new formats like online based on cognitive factors as compared to established formats  like Kirana which are chosen with more affect. Studies indicate that adoption of formats  depended on the order of entry too. With online retail ing cutting across territories as independent e - commerce retailer or as a part  of a brand or physical retailer, the consumer have started shopping differently in terms of  their search behaviour, product delivery, purchase and shipping. They expect a seamle ss  expertise across the formats. This has posed a new challenge for the companies and retailer in  terms of profitability and customer migration. Companies need to look at retailing in a new  perspective. Retailing as a business has its own dimensions.  A re tailer has to look at its busin ess more  minutely at a more dis aggregate level. Every transaction counts, every SKU counts, every  customer  counts.  It  is also  found that  customers  behave differently while  shopping  with  respect to products, service and promot ions at  different  retail  formats even when buying the  same brands. Attitudes and plans have been found to be influenced by retailers, making the  choice in favour of their promoted brands as against the context brands of the consumers. The retail sector in India is undergoing significant transition. With the entry of large scale  retailing and online , as well as marked improvement in offering a 'shopping' experience to  customers, marketers are beginning to look at the role of retailing as a brand with a pote ntial  to influence a value chain, rather than being an outcome of a value chain.  However, in spite  Prof. Piyush Kumar Sinha Page  2 of  6 of this trend, the bulk of retailing activity in the country is (and will remain) in the semi - organised and unorganised sectors. In this context,  this cour se focuses  on  managing retail as a business with several formats  working symbiotically to deliver the desired results .  O bjectives The objective of the course is to expose students to  the field of managing  omni  retailing ,  defined as an  activity that  ensures final delivery of products and services to the end customer across different formats . The perspectives, therefore, would be from both the principal (in  terms of managing retailing) and the retail businessperson (in terms of managing the retail  busi ness) in the context of a customer shopping from a combination of formats with each of  them playing different roles in the process of buying .  Pedagogy The  course  would  utilise  a  mix  of  in - class  and  project  learning  methods  including  (i)  presentations  an d  discussions  led  by  instructors,  (ii)  project  work  and  presentations  by  students,  (iii)  case  discussions  and  (iv)  presentations  and  discussion  led  by  guest  faculty  (principals,  retailers  and  consultants).  The  project  would  involve  field/store  study  to  get necessary data.  The presentations of the project work and class participation will be an  important  element  of  the  course.  In  each  case  session, the  participants  are  expected to  analyse, discuss, and suggest suitable course of action for the situation in  the assigned case.  Equally important would be the task of understanding concepts and ideas from the readings  and articles given to the participants.

The  lack  of  expertise  in  OR  within  the  organization  and  /  or  inadequate exposure at the CXO level in the organization to appreciate the  use, relevance and effectiveness of suc h  tools / techniques / concepts are  major contributing factors to the situation.  It is the firm belief of the course instructors that the PGP participants  would immensely benefit from a course which shows by  using documented  evidence  the  relevance,  applicab ility  and  effectiveness  of  Operational  Research tools, techniques and concepts to resolve challenges in practice .  This is the prime motivation to design this course.  Operational Research is  usually  taught in Business schools with a focus on  tools and tech niques. Standard textbooks are used , supported by a few  cases. We have chosen  a different view  in the design of th is course . The  central focus of th is course design is problem solving approach. The core to  the discussion is problem context. Tools and techniques are secondary.  Appropriate modelling is the name of the game. Implementation issues play  a vital role in desi gning  solu tion  approaches. PGP Elective / 2016 - 17 NR and SV 2 Keeping  these  objectives  in  mind,  we  have  assembled  a  set  of  well  documented  problem  situations  from practi ce  oriented,  academically  rigor ous  publications. The  criteria used in assembling the course material  is (a) Contemporary nature, (b)  Complex, but manageable situations, (c)  Exposure to a range of modelling tools and (d) Impact of the solutions  implemented.  A  typical  class  would focus on problem / opportunity context, challenges in  developing an approach to manage the situati on, critical discussion on the  choice of tools and techniques used in modelling,  conversations on the reported  conclusions  with an emphasis on implementation.  We are aware that building a course on a set of  academic and scientific  journals may not provide a n in - depth exposure to the tools and techniques.  This is a conscious trade - off arising out of our emphasis on bias for action.  The choice of material was influenced by the rigor , the content, which is  appropriate to the MBA students.  We  have  listed  a  set  of  classic  textbooks  which  are  to  be  used  as  supplementary reading.  T here may be a need to  reprioritize the course  material based on the first offering.  Prerequisite: There is no specific prerequisite to this course. However, an inclination and  interest to  quantitative modeling would be an advantage. Those who aspire  for a consulting career with a scientific basis would greatly benefit from this  course.  Class Size: To ensure effectiveness in the class and maximise learning objectives, we  would like to restr ict the class size to 30.  The course is meant only for PGP.  Learning Objectives: 1.  To provide an opportunity to the participants  to experience  the joy of  solving real - life, complex, meaningful administrative situations.  PGP Elective / 2016 - 17 NR and SV 3 2.  To demonstrate the power of  modelling in responding to the challenges in  a given context.  3.

Ram would be the first among his friends to  have a PDA. He was excite d about it. He opened the courier pack. The packet had the phone and a letter  from President (Sales). It was gratifying for Ram to know that he was among the chosen ones to have  received the pack. The letter was stimulating till he reached the third paragr aph. The Blackberry came  with a clause that Ram would now be handling 20% more clients from next month and his territory and  targets have been revised. The changing business and sales environment have been throwing up many unprecedented challenges.  The bus inesses are focusing on devising strategies focused to discover and deliver and communicate  desired  values  to  the  customers  to  achieve  organizational  objectives.  There  is  sea  change  in  the  environment of sales over time: information flow is faster, money f low too is faster, accounts are getting  larger, retailers are gaining power, new channels are gaining importance, and sales, distribution and  service channels are getting separated. These changes require a new way of managing the sales and  distribution fun ction for delivering customer value. The major paradigm shift is being witnessed in terms  of considering the sales and distribution function not only as pushing the product through the channel, but  enhancing the value delivered to the customers who would b uy the product at the point of sale and expect  service during buying, using and disposing the offer (product and or service).  This course has been designed to address the issues in Managing Customer Value Delivery (managing the  sales and distribution func tion) keeping in mind the new realities. 2 The course would prepare the participants to: a. Understand the role played by the sales and distribution function in delivering customer value and  achieving organizational objectives b. Design and manage a distribution system  c. Design and manage a sales force  d. Understand emerging issues in designing and managing delivery of customer value.  Contents : The course would include the following topics: o Understanding the Value Delivery System  o Designing the Value Delivery System  o Managing the Value Delivery Process o Strategic Direction for Future The course content would include cases, readings, industry presentations, and a group project (group of 5 - 6 participants). The  cases would cover a varie ty of business situations, both global and domestic, for  understanding the concepts and frameworks as applicable in practice.  Readings would provide exposure  to frameworks for understanding, designing and managing the value delivery system along with the  s trategic direction for future. Two /three senior  executives from industry would be invited to share their  experiences. The course material consists of following key resources:  (i) Course pack of cases and readings from case unit,  (ii) Books  - 1 . Sales Management - Jeff Tanner ,  Earl D. Honeycutt ,  Robert C. Erffmeyer – Prentice Hall, 2008. 2. Marketing Channels - Louis W Stern ,  Adel I. El Ansary ,  Anne T Coughlan ,  Erin  Anderson - Prentic e Hall of India, 7 th Edition. Pedagogy The pedagogy would consist of in class sessions and a group project. The class sessions would utilize a  combination of learning methods: lecture cum discussions, case discussions, presentation cum discussions  by part icipants.

Course Description and Objectives:  This c ourse  explores  how the public sphere is shaped  through  the discourses, practices and strategies  constituting the different elements of marketing  as a social activity that includes but is not limited to the transaction of  goods and services alone .  The leadi ng text on marketing management (Kotler, Keller, Koshy, and Jha 2013) articulates  marketing as a “societal process” in which groups and individuals engage with each other to  create and offer goods and services through communicative practices whereby they i dentify  needs, wants and value.  T hese leading authors identify the specific su bjects of marketing as  goods,  services  and “…events,  experiences,  persons,  places,  properties,  organisations,  information and ideas” on an equal footing  (2013: 5) .   These subjec ts represent a total perspective on how societal life is lived in the public sphere, with  implications for life systems that are public in nature. To put it summarily, p ublic systems  can be  said to be constituted by several elements that are part of this m arketing worldview where  decisions are made about the targeting /segmenting popula tions , identifying and valuing  needs  and  wants ,  delivering goods  and  services ,  designing  communications  and  disseminating information etc. These elements  are an on - going  polit ical  enactment of myths and storytelling  that narrate the relationship between society, economy and the public.  A set of myths held together by an organizing storyline or metaphor constitute the mythologies  through which actors in public space make sense  of the world and thereby act on it as well as  engage in creating it with others.  The term myth is used here as a reference to systems of belief,  espoused by social groups in furthering their worldviews. Manipulation refers to the means of  achievin g social  goals through seeking transformations in worldviews, perspectives and values of  groups and individuals. The key objective of this course is to observe and analyse concrete processes and projects linking  manipulation,  myth - making  and  marketing  in  their  impl ications  for  public  life  specifically  encompassing  themes of  gender, public health, war and social violence, media and advertising,  luxury,  democracy  and  natural  resources , mobility , and  the  environment .  It  focuses  o n  the  concrete potential of these three  linked  Ms towards  crafting  public welfare . 2 Session 1:  Myth - making in the Public Sphere Nayar, Pramod K.  2009.

Relationship of course with overall program objectives and related courses Consistent with the program objectives, the course seeks to provide students with knowledge and  awareness of  the intricate and inextricable linkages between  the seemingly separate spheres of  business management and public systems , and society.

Mysteries are not. This is because  puzzles  require thinking  through  but  essentially  call  for filling  information  gaps  in  incomplete  patterns  or  calculating  missing values by following routines or by hit - and - trial. In contrast, mysteries need new knowledge  creation and until that occurs, mys teries can remain “unthought, unexplained knowns” for long  periods. There are numerous mysteries in management that generations have hidden or pretended  they do not exist or shrugged off as unimportant or inexplicable. Some may even consider it  shameful th at in this age of Wikipedia and Google, there are still mysteries in management which  we are unable to adequately demystify and which defiantly remind us of human and organizational limits pointing to the need to place a premium on thinking over knowing if we are not to limit  management actions only to the definitively known universe . M ysteries require  reaching out for  understanding the “logic” underpinning patterns from partially  revealed  patterns before  they  can  be  grasped  or  comprehended .  This  may  be  do ne  in  the  Upanishadic “ neti, neti ” way  by a process of elimination of all but one remaining  of all  hypotheses  considered but that would be possible only for self - evident truths waiting to be discovered in  nature. In alternative traditions, one could be enc ouraging the  raising  of  all plausible working  hypotheses  and  interpretations  and  sequentially  rejecting  each  explanation  with  an  improved  version until only one - the last in a series of successive approximations of reality remains - but only  for now .  Choices  of conceptual convenience require trade - offs between stochastic systems which  have underlying determinate laws and any determinate system that may be regarded as the limiting  case of a stochastic system This  course covers  a selection of ten important myst eries in management together with an attempt  to demystify them to the extent it is possible to do so. These are chosen from among a  much larger  number of mysteries that have continued to intrigue generations of scholars, practitioners, policy - makers and co ncern  some of the most  relevant,  difficult and controversial aspects of management. 2 Course Objectives This course has the following objectives:  Familiarising participants with how concepts and praxis challenge each other  and to the need  for persistent questioning of received knowledge, of acknowledged ignorance and of  little  understood  phenomena that make s us wonder   Developing insights into  why certain imbalances such as underrepresentation of women in  electoral and prof essional life in most vocations persists over time and across geographies .   Understanding  the connections between the design of  management processes,  control  systems  and organisation structures.  Building knowled ge and skills for insights to conduct  inquiries to verify and understand dark  sides of leadership, managerial productivity, and management succession .  Developing curiosity and capacity to investigate and make  decisions under uncertainty  with a  better  understanding  of  boundary  conditions  that  affect  scale,  scope  and  sustainability  of  organizational actions concerning tasks and people and enable pattern recognition of complex  management phenomena.. Pedagogy  Each session will introduce a contextualized mystery in management demystified to the e xtent  of what is known inviting discussion on what more may be knowable. T ogether with concept  building and spaces for reflection ,  there will be opportunities  to enable participants learn from  their own experience of grappling with phenomena through exerci ses .  Learning through concepts and class praxis will be supplemented with recommended readings,  and  through class presentations . Evaluation The  course  grade would be based on:  Class Preparation and Participation 2 5 %  Reflective Journal  5 0%  Home  A ssignment  25% The  10 - session plan follows: 3 Session Plan Session 1 Introduction to the Course .

What is a Reflective Journal? Your Reflective Journal (RJ) is your personal  conversation with yourself for your own learning  and the issues involved in your learning processes about Mysteries in Management. Your RJ is  to record, review, reflect, understand, and explore more from various perspectives and keep a  record of your thoug hts, feelings, as you chew over the discussions and assimilate readings  from this course.. A RJ is not a collection of notes done in the class or during your learning process. It is based on  your reflections. Make a habit of reviewing your learning after  every class, after every reading  associated with any of the sessions and any other library materials, websources you are inspired  to look for and record your own experiences and observations on a file which is kept with you  and belongs to  you to  be submitt ed to the Course Instructor only once for evaluation on  30.10.2015 .   Note that it is your own text from your own perspective that counts. Do not reproduce any text  from any source, unless you make a quote (max 4 - 5 lines with full references; see IIMA cit ation  guide). However, note that quotes are used only to support your own text, not to be the main  text. If you wish to attach any (short) articles, do it as an attachment (with full references). Note  that attachments are not counted as the main text and a re only supplements. Otherwise, always  write your own text and paraphrase or summarise text you are referring to in your own words.  The RJ is submitted both electronically and on paper, so you need to do it by computer.  Whenever you share your own experi ences, remember that RJ is not a confessional diary, but  reflective.  This  means  that  any  experiences  encountered  can  be  reviewed,  analysed  and  connected from a learning point of view. Develop your skills on how to recognise, interpret and  act upon issues y ou come across.  Process of Reflective journal On Day one (today), start your journal by reflecting what your own expectations from the  course are and what you think “mysteries in management” are or could be. Rely on your own  views.   Reflective journal is kept automatically. This means that you need to write it without  being told. Whenever there are tasks that need to be incorporated in the reflective journal, it  would be said so in the class. For each contact session, you need to consider what happened ,  what you learnt  and what old or new questions arose in your mind.  Contents of the Reflective journal Based on the presentations, discussions, reading materials, exercises, and your own notes, the  diary length expected is of approx. 3500 - 6000 words, line spacing 1.5. This means you will  write the RJ assignment based on the above. Use of articles, books, fi lms, and own experiences  as reflection resources is strongly encouraged, but always cite references! 7 RJ must minimally contain, but is not limited to, the following: ־ Dated entries from each class (10) ־ Highlights of class discussions: What do you thin k were the most important things in the  discussions? Why were these important? ־ Highlights of provided or referred to reading materials: What do you think were the  most important issues in the reading materials? Why?  ־ What did you learn? Evaluate their  importance with respect to course topics.  ־ What did you fail to learn? Why and how would you wish to correct that? ־ What new learning wishes arose for you? ־ Did the discussions give you new ideas about the topic or did it encourage you to try out  somet hing yourself?  ־ Did you discuss the topics with anyone (before/after the lecture, at work, at home etc.)?  ־ What were your own expectations for the discussions/topic? What did you want to  learn?  ־ Try to analyze, how did you learn things or why do you  think you didn't learn? At the end of the RJ, reflect (2 - 3 pages) on the following: ־ Do you think you could have improved your learning somehow? ־ What kept you from improving this? ־ Analyze how and where you could apply your learnings and how these rel ate to your  work/studies/home organization? ־ Were you able to apply these concepts in your everyday life/business? ־ Were there any things that were left unclear or that you didn't understand? What did you  do to understand them? ־ What do you think will b e most invaluable to you from the course in terms of the future? ־ Other comments and feedback (Faculty, course, arrangements, materials, new mysteries  that should be assigned to sessions ). ־ Make a self - evaluation and give yourself a grade (between A+ to F) as a learner, based  on your learning process and reflective journal. Give justifications why you should be given this  grade. General guidelines In order to write the RJ journal effectively, you actually need to make notes after every session  and  actively write your personal reflective journal after the sessions. ־ Make minimum 3 entries per week (or after each class) ־ Make entries daywise and put a date on the entry. ־ Make notes of interesting observations and readings which have relevance to or reflect  aspects of to Mysteries in Management  ־ Adhere  to  the  dateline!  Late  submissions  invite  penalties.  No  submissions  after  30.10.2015 . ־ Remember  to  write  your  name,  student  number  (roll.no),  section,  and  your  email  address. ־ When returning your RJ as printed submission, make sure you have signed your copy on  the first page. This is mandatory.   ־ Try altering your study methods and habits and see if some new style helps you to  understand things more easily.  8 About the submission: - when returning  the hard copy, remember to sign your assignment on the title page - send the material in *.doc format.  - name the soft copies as: 201 5 mym RJ _yourname.doc Home Assignment (25% weightage) Complete your home assignment and turn it in by email to anmathur@ii mahd.ernet.in and  provide a printed out version to Ankur Sumesra in Wing 6 - A  by  30.9.2015 17:00. The Task 1. Formulate/Identify  questions  (any  number  greater  than  5  but  less  than  12)  that  management and leadership literature does not answer reliably or  does not currently ask. Hint: One possible trigger to think of such questions would be to recall courses you have  studied (and enjoyed or hated/tolerated!) and remind yourself of those aspects of these courses  that you still remember because they aroused emotions or passions or frustrations or brought  thoughts around questions of significance that remained unexamined or unanswered. Other  triggers  could  be  to  turn  to  business  media  (business  magazines  or  business  channels  on  television) or indeed anything  else that brings you a muse.  2. Select five questions from this list to keep on your final shortlist based on any one or  more of the following criteria: • The question has significant implications for designing business models or task systems,  or organiz ation structures or management processes. OR • The  question  involves  exercise  of  authority  or  power  in  relation  to  resources  or  responses. OR • The question involves decision - making about any of the boundaries of an open system - task, time, territory,  sentience, technology, understanding OR • The question involves setting rate of engagement with primary task OR • The question has implications about quality of life, work - life or work - life balance. 3. Explore each of the five questions as mysteries limit ing yourself to no more than 1 - 2  pages per mystery/question  i.e. total of minimum 5 and maximum 10 pages and attaching your  initial list in Step one above as Annexure I.

Methodology : The methodology adopted will be a combination of the case method, and classroom  simulations/exercises, including role plays.  There will be individual assignment involving analysis of  a case (text or video). The group assignment will invo lve  collecting data on the communication  situations faced by managers and  presenting  analysis  of the collected data  to generate insights for  managerial actions. There will be an interim presentation of the group assignment in the class room (sessions  15 an d  16 ) as well as final submission in the form of  a written  report .  2 |  P a ge Evaluation scheme: Class participation 2 0%  (Individual, inclusive of attendance and reflective notes on the  learning from the sessions )  Assignments  5 0% ( Group project 30%;  Individu al assignment 20% )  Mid - term examination 30% Individual  assignment  would  involve  analysis  of  an  organizational  communication  situation  contained in a case (text or video).

These days, even plain managing of  bosses, colleagues, subordinates, and customers call  for heavy doses of persuasion. You  also need to guard against being persuaded too easily or fraudulently.  You may be intuitively persuasive and may have managed well  so far. But if you want to be  a surer persuader in a wide range of contexts, you need to look systematically at the  persuasion processes, try out strategies, reflect on them, and refine them. PC attempts to  provide you with the context and tools for it.  PC will help you:  Understand the process and features of persuasive communication  Identify your own persuasive style and potential   Enhance your repertoire of persuasive communication techniques  Make your presentations and public speaking persuasive   Refin e the persuasiveness of your written communication  Become more resistant to undesirable/fraudulent persuasion  How we go about the job  We will have a blend of learning experiences including (i) analysis of cases, (ii) role - plays  and other exercises invol ving persuasive spoken and written communication followed by  analysis and feedback, (iii) articulation of persuasion experiences and their critical analysis,  (iv) close examination of persuasive texts and/or episodes from history and literature, (vi)  some  exposure to theoretical insights through reviews of articles/books on persuasion, and  (vii) a project. The essential readings and cases are indicated here; role - play materials and  some additional readings will be supplied as we go along.  You will be divi ded into teams and a substantial part of your work will be done in your team because peer feedback is critical in learning to be persuasive . Intense participation is  expected of everyone.  Right from day one all students are urged to contribute to a speci al, exclusive blog or  an other social media platform that everyone is comfortable with : It will  help  us chronicle  extra  explorations of persuasion during the course.

Yet  more  frustrating  could  be  the  realization  that  what  you  achieved was not in your interest; rather more powerful others had shaped your interests and your  thought  - proces s to their advantage.  This course addresses the afore - mentioned issues in two parts.  The first part aims at improving your ability to diagnose the underlying distribution of power in the  process of organizing (teams, groups, business and other social, cul tural, political organizations) and  enhance your effectiveness in exercising power in organizational settings towards better outcomes for  those involved. It also helps understand power and politics in organizing the perspectives that govern  our relation sh ipwith others at different levels. Course Objectives Over the past two centuries, networks of corporations, The State, and supra - national institutions have  grown  in  their  power  to  the  extent  that  they  have  become  more  powerful  than  many  individual  governm ents  and  civil  societies.  To  work  in  and  with  such  powerful  organizations  mere  skills  to  understand the political landscape of a corporation/State from a single standpoint and attempt to shape  it to some ideal purpose are not sufficient. It calls for a dee per understanding of the ways organizations  shape our thought and behavioral patterns which in turn limits and shapes the nature of our proposed  interventions to bring change. Therefore, a key aim is to generate a grasp of the complex relationships  between power, politics and knowledge in organizational settings. This is achieved through discussion of  a range of theories of power, and re - visiting distribution and exercise of power in organizational settings  and the importance of using power ethically.  2 Course Administration The course will comprise 20 sessions of 75 minutes each. There will be a combination of cases, lectures,  videos, exercises, guest speakers, group - work, guided large group discussions designed to illustrate the  power dynamics in groups /organizing processes.

Through  enacted physicality, participants are able to enter the hitherto (un)experienced worlds in  order  to  develop  a  deep  relational  understanding  of  rationality,  justice,  systems  (of  thought and ac tion) and processes that have a profound impact on the way social lives are  constructed whether in an urban informal settlement, an elite gated housing society, a  government department or a corporate boardroom. The design of this  course engages  participant s  with  the methods and techniques of  participatory developmental theatre, towards enacting social change. This engagement  will consist of facilitation of group and individual theatrical processes. This training will  be in a form of a workshop that will be  conducted both at IIMA as well as Ahmedabad's  Budhan Theatre. The  core  objective  of  this  course is  to  add  to  the  skill  set  of  future  managers  by  developing communicative strategies in group/teamwork that are based on the lived  experiences of the team membe rs, privileging the development of collective goals and  shared values, and the capacity for empathetic leadership. The Budhan Theatre, Ahmedabad is not only a theatre performance group but also a site  of profound social complexity and change; brought about through theatrical engagement.  Here, the Budhan Theatre's actors, who are both  actors in the traditional sense, as well as  the  'en - actors'  of  their  own  communities  transformation  will  facilitate  the  course  participants' thinking processes enabling them to enter their own world through a variety  of theatrical techniques. The  outcome  of  the  course  will  include  performances  using  a  variety  of forms  of  expression  chosen  by  participant  groups  over  the  duration  of  the  course.

Relationship of course with overall program objectives and related courses  The course seeks to provide  students  with  communication  and  leadership  skills  that  are  more in  line  with  open  and  equitable  relationships in their sphere of work. These communicative forms encourage ideas about organizational,  social, cultural transformation rooted in cooperative group processes, departing from an orientation that  privileges aut horitative individuals as agents of change. It also seeks to develop alternative learning  pedagogies where the students of higher education can learn more directly about the social experiences of  those who are marginalized, in order to develop skills of em pathetic leadership.

With customers embracing Internet  through digital devices like desktop computers, lap tops, personal digital assistants, notebooks, mobil e  phones, and tablets, it has led to changes in the w ay businesses and customers transact products and  services. As a result, e-business - transactions in volving buying and selling products and services ov er  Internet, has shown remarkable growth all over the  world and in India. eMarketer estimated that B2C  e-business worldwide sales was worth $ 1.47 trillio n in 2014 and is estimated to reach $2.356 trillion in 2018, adding more than $ 200 billion of sales ev ery year. By some estimates, Indian e-business  market is set to rise from $11 billion in 2013 to $ 137 billion by 2020, thus becoming world's fastest  growing e-business market. While these numbers are  significant in absolute terms, they also highlight  the galloping rate of growth. Along with the change s in metrics over past few years, it is also  important to understand the basic changes which hav e been brought about in the way human beings  think, behave, act, interact, and conduct business.  The impact on the world of management and  business is significant in many ways. This course a ims to provide an understanding of this impact, and prepare participants to effectively navigate this n ew and fast evolving world.  The scope of this course is essentially “e-business  strategy” and “strategies for digital marketing”.  There are therefore two important objectives of the  course:  a) To recognize and appreciate the differences between  a traditional business and an e-business, to  understand the strategic drivers for success in e-b usiness, and to learn the tools and techniques to  implement an e-business strategy effectively.  b) To gain an overall understanding of what constitute s digital marketing, and to understand and  select key strategies required for a successful and  effective digital marketing program.   With these two objectives being met, students will  have acquired the skills and the perspectives  required to think strategically and achieve specifi c business goals using digital marketing or running an e-business, like customer acquisition, loyalty,  brand building, market entry, customer insight, new product development and content generation.  2 This course will be useful for all business managem ent students, and especially those interested in a  career in marketing, entrepreneurship, consulting o r strategy.

Apart from the cases and notes/articles provided in  this casemat, additional cases and notes/articles  (as  and when provided by guest speakers) will be distri buted from the Case Unit.   PEDAGOGY:  Digital devices are going to be the way of life in  the future. As every research study on digital devi ce  usage suggests, which we also know intuitively, it  is the medium of the future. Usage of digital  devices is evolving every day and the next cool ide a may make everything obsolete before it. This has  a direct bearing on how this course will be taught  and learnt. The usual methods of teaching –  structured sessions and case study discussions – ar e important to understand the history and evolution of the Internet and current digital marketing pract ices. But it is even more important during this cou rse  and later as marketing professionals that participa nts think independently about this medium. They  should use their own personal experience as active  and advanced users of the Internet and digital  devices to bring fresh perspectives and think compe titively. In class, students are encouraged to  actively participate in discussions and share their  experience and ideas. We can all learn from each  other, and the next Facebook may well emerge from s omeone among us!  In the spirit of sharing and learning, and in case  of any questions, students should feel free to call  or  email the instructor.  EVALUATION:   Class Participation and Attendance:  20%   (Individu al Grading)  Group Assignments/Presentations:   20%   (Group Grad ing)  Final Group Project:   25%   (Group Grading)  Final Examination:   35%   (Individual Grading)  Class Participation and Attendance  Students  will  be  evaluated  on  their  preparedness  fo r  the  class  and  their  ability  to  actively,  meaningfully, and constructively participate during  discussions in the classroom.   Attendance is compulsory for all sessions of the co urse. In case of exigencies, a student is excused  from attending sessions by providing documented rea sons. For frequent absences especially with no  valid written reason provided, the student will los e credit for Class Participation and Attendance  grades. Faculty discretion will be used for additio nal penalties including impact on overall grade if  such absences by said student persist through the c ourse.  3 Group Assignments and Presentations  All groups will submit their assignments before the  start of the relevant session. Grading will be bas ed  on the submitted assignment which should not exceed  6 pages in length. Details about assignment will  be provided in class.   Final Group Project  Brief:  Take an online business (B2C retail, marketplace, r eviews and rating site, classifieds, travel  portal, matrimony, app based business, other) and e valuate their business model from the following  perspectives   a. Business model (B2C retail, marketplace, reviews an d rating site, classifieds, travel portal,  matrimony, app based business, other)  b. Revenue model (in India or any specific geography t he team is looking at – ads, transaction  cut, listing fee, subscription, average numbers)  c. Addressable market (for both service providers and  customers)  d. Revenue scalability  e. Key growth drivers  f. Cost structures   g. Margin structure  h. Key operational metrics to track  i. Differentiation that the team can bring (future enh ancements)  j. Learning from global markets  k. Scalability of the idea in international markets (i f possible)  For example one may choose a business like  Zomato  and evaluate it on each of the below given  parameters -   a. Business model –  Restaurant discovery and (now) ordering platform  b. Revenue model -  listing fee + advertising on site + revenue share f rom orders placed on  Zomato  c. Addressable market –  restaurants in India – fragmented and unorganised m arket, therefore  need for a neutral search and discovery platform wi th user ratings. A number of customers  with access to smartphones, internet which potentia lly could access the service  d. Revenue scalability -  domestic - regional scalability high - number of re staurants is large and  growing, grows with number of orders from existing  and new customers  e. Growth drivers -  India consumption, internet and mobile internet pen etration, small and  medium merchants growing spend on digital advertisi ng  f. Cost structure s - salary of sales and listing staff, marketing, t echnology, hosting bandwidth,  other admin  g. Margin structure -  high operating leverage as most costs are fixed cos t - margin increases  with scale  h. Key  operational  metrics  to track -  number  of  visitors,  time  on  site,  number  of repeat  visitors,  number  of  reviewers,  number  of  restaurant s,  number  of  paid  and  repeat  paid  restaurants, number of advertising restaurants, lis ting per personnel, listing across geography,  # of restaurants offering delivery, orders placed o n each restaurant, ticket size per order ($),  order frequency per customer, order per restaurant,  inactive restaurants  4 i. Differentiation -  quality of content and depth of content, number of  restaurants, veracity of  content and reviews, Interface of site and applicat ion and customer service on phone, multi  touch point to customer  j. Learning from global markets  - yelp's success, Google’s way of continuous moneti zation  through advertising by SME’s, other review sites bu siness model, ordering business model in  global markets (Foodpanda)  k. Scalability of the idea to global markets -  high, once model is proven in one large market  like India - easy to replicate through sales teams  in global markets. Realization per restaurant  higher in global markets than India. High operation al leverage has good impact on margins.  Ordering business can be expanded through restauran t partner’s delivery network.   Deliverables and evaluation:   1. Make a presentation detailing the business on each  parameter, submit a report about the same  through email before the last session of SDME.   2. Groups would be required to present in 10 min prese ntation on the final session of SDME.  3. Put as many assumptions clearly as you may be requi red to make.  4. Groups would not be measured on the scalability of  the idea chosen, but on the depth of their  analysis  5. Groups may add more parameters on the evaluation li st (apart from the 11 mentioned above),  but these 11 are a must.  6. Length of report is not material.  7. Make sure you reference sources of data and studies  used in support. For the group assignment and project work in this c ourse, participants are expected to form  groups of  five-six (5-6) members .  Final Examination  There will be a written examination.  ----x----  5 Strategies for Digital Marketing and e-Business (SD ME)  Detailed Session-wise Schedule    Session No.  Date/ Day  Case / Reading / Guidelines f or Preparation   1-2  7 th  January  (Thursday)  Topic: Introduction to Digital Marketing and e-Busi ness  Case:  Infibeam (A)  Readings:  1.

By seeking to merge the creation of societal value with more  market  like  pursuits,  it  seeks  to  engage  individuals  who  are  interested  in  cont ributing to society but either wary of or intimidated by the traditional actors  in the social space.  The specific objectives of the course are to help participants:   Understand the need and role of social entrepreneurs in society   Tensions in organization s working in this space   Understanding  models of social enterprises  Course Design The course is a full unit course and will have 25 sessions of 75 minutes each. The  classroom sessions will be a mix of case discussion, instructor lectures, guest  lectures and student presentations.

The uniqueness  of this course lies in the predominant use of cases on emerging market firms and context. There  are cases that look at firms from emerging economies like India, China, Russia, Brazil, and  Israel. The course introduces students to issues of institutional voids in an emerging market and  how these voids sometimes hinder growth of firms. At the same time, the emerging economy  context gives firms opportunity to innova te, develop different business models, and gain  competitive advantage over firms from developed economies. In addition, the course touches  upon the issues related to business groups, family businesses, and culture - all of which are  important features of the emerging markets esp. India. The course focuses on the role  government, industry, and firm and its stakeholders play in gaining and sustaining competitive  advantage by a firm in an emerging economy context.  Course Structure and Pedagogy  The course has been structured into  three modules . These are:  Module One:  Introduction to Strategy in Emerging Markets  Module Two:  Opportunities and Challenges in Emerging Markets for Local Firms  Module Three:  Foreign MNCs in Emerging Markets: Opportunities and Challenges  The dominant pedagogy for this course would be the case method. Rigorous analysis of cases  provides opportunities to simulate “real world” inside the classroom as well as enable  participative learning.  Course Materials  The course packet contains all the cases and the reading material.

S trategic decisions of companies depend on  findings from  data analysis tasks such as  estimating market share of a product,  deciphering the latent reasons underlying a consumer’s basket  of  product  preferences,  prediction  of  defaults  on  a  bank’s  loan  portfolio etc .  Therefore,  design,  collection and  analysis of data  have been  play ing a n increasingly crucial role in decision making.   This course  introduces participants to some  modern statistical  techniques in data analysis . While the  course  is  primarily  application  focused,  it  will  provide  adequate  theoretical  background  so  that  participants can con fidently  formulate and  apply these techniques in real life situations. Session wise list of topics is provided below. Pre - requisites a) Good knowledge of concepts of probability and statistics introduced on PS - 1, PS - 2 and PS - 3  courses in PGP 1 st year. b) Knowledge of mathematics at graduation level is desirable. c) Familiarity with computer programming   in any language is desirable. Software a) Partic ipants need to learn  soft wares R , Excel and mini - tab on their own. b) The R software is freely downloadable from  http://cran.rproject.org c) It is expected that participants will use R , Excel or Minitab for solving most of the  assignments. d) It is expected that participants bring their laptop to class for working on data analysis  pr oblems.

The role of cities as “engines  of economic growth” is now well established. This course examines the evolving role of cities as  centers of production and consumption and the manner in which businesses can co ntribute to the  growth of the local economy as well as benefit from the opportunities that a city offers. A key objective of the course is to provide basic understanding of macroeconomic frameworks for  urban economic analysis and to show how these concept s could be applied in formulating local  economic development strategies and shaping business decisions of firms. The first half of the course deals with theories of location, urban land use, scale economies and  models of urban economic growth. In the seco nd half, the focus shifts to  specific  urban policies  and issues of urban governance. The major topics to be covered are urban tra nsport, infrastructure  development, slum redevelopment strategies , and innovative land management approaches.  Case  studies bas ed on international experiences would be used to examine policies and strategies for  addressing urban issues. Course Administration The course will have 15 classroom sessions of 75 minutes each. In some of the sessions students  will be expected to make  short presentations of papers/cases and initiate discussion of the main  issues. The grading scheme will be as follows: Class participation : 15% Case presentation (group) : 15% Issue paper (group) : 20% End - term exam : 50% Note: There are no pre requisites for this course. There are no limitations on maximum class size  and students are not expected to incur any out of pocket expenses for the course.

Alternative investments is not only about exposure to non traditional asset classes like commodities, but also about investment in traditional asset classes in non traditional ways that exploit the freedom to use leverage and short selling as well as the greater ability to create non linear payoﬀs. The course is intended to provide a good understanding of: \u000f The major alternative investment asset classes. \u000f The principal hedge fund strategies and styles. \u000f The most important alternative investment vehicles like hedge funds, venture capital and private equity. It is oriented towards: \u000f Those who seek to invest in alternative investment vehicles. \u000f Those that seek to set up or manage such vehicles. The course may also be of use to those who have no involvement in alternative investments but wish to operate in markets which are heavily in\ruenced by the activities (like high frequency trading) of hedge funds. Pre-requisites The course assumes reasonable knowledge of traditional investment, asset allocation and portfolio man- agement of the kind that would come from doing a course like Modern Investment and Portfolio Man- agement (MIPM). Similarly, it presumes basic knowledge of derivatives such as could be obtained from a course like Futures, Options and Risk Management (FORM).

Despite  significant market potential, there is a dearth of analytical talent  – data scientist s (akin to the Wall Street q uants of the 1990s) , analyst s and managers  – to leverage  the economic value of big data . Big data analysis is likely to fuel the next wave of growth in productivity, innovation,  and competition in the market place.  The organizations ability to unlock the  potential  of big data and lead in the market place will be largely determined by its ability to  tackle major hurdles in  effectively  managing big data  – identifying  the business use  case, hiring, nurturing and retaining the right analytical talent for condu cting big data  analytics, and embracing data driven culture for making  business  decisions . This course aims to help the participants to build a solid foundation on big data. It will  enable the participants to learn, design and build big data analytic s olutions  to solve business  problems and  improve  decision  making .  T he  course  will  also  help  participants  to  understand  various  issues,  challenges  and  best  practices  in  implementing  big data analytic solutions in organizations.

Income tax applies to all  individuals  and  corporate  persons  who  earn  income.  Excise  duty  applies  to  manufacturing of goods. Custom duty is levied when any person imports goods.  Value  Added  Tax  applies  t o  sale  of  goods.  Service  tax  applies  to  provision  of  services. Each of the taxes has a different basis. In addition, some taxes are applied  by the states, for example, VAT, while others are levied by the Centre.  Every stage of business or management prac tice involves incidence(s) of taxation.  Towards compliance with the requirements of the tax law, business practices have to  be optimally structured. Further, every contract or project has to be conceived with  incidences  of  taxation.  As  the  incidences  of  ta xation  change  every  year,  the  relationship of taxation and management practices have to be continually appraised.  Thus, it is imperative for a manager to be well versed with the foundation and  incidences of taxation in India. Objective The objective of t he course is to introduce the participants to the basis , incidence and  application of the main taxes in India, namely, income tax, excise, service tax and  Value Added Tax.

Ped agogy The pedagogy include s discussi on of  cases and readings by participants , presentation - cum - discussion by senior executives from industry, and  conducting, sharing, and learning from  project work.   Participants would form themselves in groups of 6 for pre - class discussions, presentations  on readings and cases, and project work.  Each group should consist of members from  diverse backgrounds, mix of programmes, and Indian and foreign participants. At least  one member  each of a  group should have taken the  course  (i)  Strategic Marketing and  (ii) CCCS. Request participants of the two courses to voluntarily spread themselves across  the groups. Page  3 of  11 The  case discussions would be in the format of decision making as well as seminar type  group presentations cum discus sions.  For  presentations  on  readings,  r equired readings must  be  gone  through  individually .  Learning from  s uggested readings can be divided with  in  a group by  assigning one  reading to a member. However,  learning from each  suggested  reading should be share d  with in  the group before coming to the class.   Individual groups would be assigned  readings for presentation cum discussion in the class .  Guidelines for presentation of readings are: 1. Identify the key concepts, techniques, processe s and conclusions in the reading 2. Critique the reading by relating  its learning  to a case or situation in the course or  outside this course 3. The presentation  must n ot b e more than 4 slides and should   not exceed 10 minutes Guidelines for  project work are provided separately  lat er in the text . Work Load The workload  in the course  is equivalent to 30 sessions and a participant is expected to put  in a total  of  about 100 hours, including class  sessions . A total of  about  3 2 Sessions have  been planned .  Of these couple  of double sess ions  have been planned  for presentation cum  discussions with senior  executives from  industry , couple of sessions would be given off  for project work , and couple of sessions would be used for project presentations .

For  making  the  strategic  choice  of  where  to  market/compete ,  a  customer  value  based  segmentation  scheme  would  need to  be designed  on  the  basis  of  thorough  analysis  of  information from  both secondary and primary sources . Th e final choice  of where to market/  compete  (and prioritization of market/ segments)  would depend on the evaluation of the  options (segments) so generated on their (i) attractiveness (gain) to and (ii) competitiveness  (pain) of the company. Develop ment of  strategic  plan for  how to market/ compete in the selected market / segments ( s ) would  include  all  the  analysis  and  recommendations  on  (i)  superior  customer  value  proposition, (ii) systems for  deliver ing and communicating the  superior value proposition , (iii)  processes,  capabilities,  organizational  design,  and  resources  (technical,  human,  and  financial) needed for implementing the systems, (iv) for meeting organizational objectives  and vision .

Both economic and social enterprises will come to play a  predominant  role  in  addressing  the  unmet  social  needs  around  the  world.  The  deepening of democratic processes is unleashing the social aspirations, which in many  cases cannot be met either by the state or the market adequately.   In such cases, new  hybrid forms of organisations are bound to emerge.  It is generally believed that if  markets have to expand, state may have to contract.  However, the experience of last  few decades in India and many other developing countries and some of the developed  countries as well shows that financial support from private sector at an early stage  when even  proof of concept may not exist is extremely difficult. The role of state thus  becomes important.  When the Honey Bee Network moved from micro finance to micro  venture innovation finance [MVIF], the support came from the state.  Most angel funds  and venture funds invest much later in the life of an enterprise.  By then, 80  – 90 per  cent mortality of startups ideas may have taken place.  This course will try to generate  alternative  perspective,  both  in  theory  and  practice  for  tapping  the  creative  and  entrepre neurial spirit of our society.   Creativity  requires  freedom  to  think,  flexibility  to  act  and  functioning  beyond  boundaries 1 .   Management of creative processes often is constrained by the limits of  norms, rules, roles and resources.   One has to tune the structure of governance, trigger  the processes of accountability and support grassroots and also top down initiatives.   Creativity  does  not  necessarily  always  lead  to  innovation.  But  sometimes,  it  does.     Nurturing  creativity  requires  tolerance  for  devi ance,  dissent  and  diversity .  The  1 You can also kill creativity very easily, the ten killers often mentioned are:  1) Always pretend to know more  than everybody around, 2)  Get employees to fill in time sheets., 3) Run daily checks on progress of everyone's  work., 4)  Ensure that highly qualified people do mundane work for long periods., 5 ) Put barriers up between  dep artments. 6) Don't speak personally to employees, except when announcing increased targets, shortened  deadlines and tightened cost restraints. 7) Ask for a 200 - page document to justify every new idea. 8) Call lots of  meetings.9) Place the biggest emphasis  on the budget and 10) Buy lots of computers.,   source:  http://www.1000advices.com/guru/organization_10ways2murder.html downloaded on December 15, 2010 1 organisational  culture,  which  encourages  creative  ways  of  solving  problems,  also  accommodates  planned  failures.  Courting  uncertainty  becomes  a  mantra,  marrying  meandering with spontaneity becomes the style .    Very few innovative technologies or  processes succeed in the market place.  And yet, in the absence of a precise predictive  test, one has to try many approaches knowing fully well that only a few will survive.   Innovations need not necessarily take pl ace in the same way at all the levels in the  organisation or among the clients or users.  There is a widespread interest in the  user  - driven as  distinct  from  user  – innovations (von  Hippel,  2010)  that  influence  the  organisational choices.  However, the op en innovation movement begun by the Honey  Bee Network 25 years ago has become a mainstream movement today. Which users/or  non - users are involved in triggering which kind of innovations also depends upon the  values underlying the motivations of innovators a nd/or firms or other collaborative  platforms.    In this course, we will explore and understand the relationship between individual,  institutional and societal creativity in coping with risks and uncertainties, overcoming  various  environmental  challenges  as  a  part  of  circular  economy  for  designing  the  futures.   The innovations need not always diffuse within or outside the organization.  The incentives for developing innovations that diffuse widely may not be very difficult  to design.   But incentives for d eveloping innovations that enable people in limited  locations, specific situations with or without handicaps are more difficult to design. The  intrinsic motivations  ( swantayhsukhay ) often outweigh the  extrinsic  motivations  for  innovations.   Identifying th e right blend of both is a challenge that leaders have to face.   The  Long  Tail  of  Innovations (Anderson,  2006) 2 is  an  important  characteristic  of  innovation eco - system.  That is, a large number of innovations are suitable for small  niches and thus may di ffuse very locally or in a limited way, but they make place for a  few which diffuse widely.  The  long nose of innovation (Buxton, 2008) on the other hand  implies a long wait before a major breakthrough occurs. The computer mouse took  thirty years to become popular after its discovery in the sixties.  2 http://issuu.com/david.dencker/docs/the_long_tail_innovation_model, also see a thesis on the concept,  David  Dencker, 2008, downloaded on Dec 15, 2010 Knowledge of the processes that trigger creativity and innovation in some situations  more easily than others, is available more often with those who can break rules, or have  capacity for dissenting and transfo rming the context.  One reason many companies are  seeking solutions  (crowdsourcing or mass - sourcing ideas 3 ) from outside  is  that too  much of congruence with in internal R and D has led to lesser diversity and thus lower  levels of creativity. Why would diss enters share their knowledge with others?  This  knowledge could be tacit or explicit, episodic or concurrent, transient or stable and  isolated or networked.   Too much of connectedness in an organisation or a society may  prevent the minimum isolation that  is necessary for innovative ideas to emerge, grow  and get institutionalised or go forward..   It is true, however, that not all innovative ideas  need to get institutionalised.   Social Networking may be good for very many purposes  but  it  seldom  helps  in  tr iggering  creative  ideas  and  getting  traction  for  large - scale  missions (Iranian elections or Tunisian revolution were exceptions, were they?). Also  see 4 graphic discussion on how women in Africa have struggled against various kind of  injustice by harnessing aesthetics of dissent and alienation. Knowledge  networks  reflect  the  way  ideas  flow  among  those  who  share  common  concerns  even  if  they  lack  the  consensus  about  the  way  these  concerns  should  be  articulated.  But these networks need to continuously discove r strangers from outside  the  network  whose  skills  and  perspective  are  needed.  They  shouldn’t  have  strong  gatekeepers who often behave like a third/second class railway compartment inmate  (as long as one is outside, you wish to get in, but once you are in,  you want to keep  others  out).  The  divergence  of  perspectives  facilitates  the  creation  of  knowledge  networks.   Societal norms and culture facilitate the creation of these networks in some  situations and inhibit the same in other situations.  Indian society has demonstrated  different  processes  through  which  knowledge  networks  have  emerged  at  different  points of time in history around specific technological and institutional challenges.  In  the wake of globalisation, new ways of creating networks and managing knowledge  3 see,  Barry L Bayus, 2013, Crowdsourcing New Product Ideas over Time: An Analysis of the Dell IdeaStorm  Community, Management Science 59(1), pp. 226 – 244,http://public.kenan - flagler.unc.edu/faculty/bayusb/WebP age/Papers/Crowdsourcing.pdf 4 JUDE G.

Entrepreneurial  ventures  without  appropriate  knowledge  networks are unlikely to ever succeed. The relationship between natural, social, ethical and intellectual capital lays the ground  for  entrepreneurship  of  different  kinds  to  emerge.  Social  innovations/entrepreneurship  may  provide  legitimacy  for  creating  a  safety  net  that  helps budding economic entrepreneurs.   Too much emphasis on individual innovations  and  entrepreneurship  may  in  due  course,  dilute  the  pressure  for creating  social  communities that share knowledge, provide support and nurture creativity. The time  has come to look at a range of entrepreneurial forms, such as conventional individual  led  start - ups,  cooperative  ventures,  network  enterprises,  cooperative/ s  of  entrepreneurs,  commonly  owned  enterprise  to  serve  member  entrepreneurs  (e.g.  micromaticmachine tools), fluid enterprise (episodic like matrix companies, embedded  enterprises (like  living - in partners may be) pay - as - you - wish business models, pay - if - earn ing assured (energy audit start - ups being paid a part of the savings they ensure)  and new services models creating benchmarks and standards for industries to trigger  innovations,  horizontal  supply  chains  as  against  conventional  vertical  ones,  supply  chain  based  incubation  of  vendors/manufacturers  etc.  Cultural  enterprises/cooperatives/agencies  may  create  markets  for  folk  artists,  authors,  performers, sculptors etc. There  is  a  revolution  waiting  to  happen  in the  entrepreneurial  space.  This  course  intends t o break new ground by fertilizing imagination, challenging dogmatic comfort,  celebrating irreverence through performance rather than promise.  Get good grades by  creating small or big miracles and social or commercial businesses/platforms and not just  by wr iting business plans ( for a pseudo cv point!) or just the project reports which may line  the shelves . Pedagogy: The course will encourage participants to look at the knowledge systems from a multi - cultural perspective so that the dynamics of dissent and diversity can be understood  properly.   The purpose of an innovative organisation or a society is not only to expa nd  the choices but also elongate the time frame of decision - making.  Sustainability is not  possible if the time frame is  short  and the decision - making horizon is  narrow .    The pedagogy of the course will involve encounters with innovators/ entrepreneurs a t  grassroots  as  well  as  in  high  tech  sectors,  service  spaces,  cultural  economy,  and  generating  businesses  through  entrepreneurial  workshops.  But  all  this  will  rest  completely on the initiatives of students. Lesser you dig deep, lesser surprises you get.  Do we really live the day when we have not been surprised? (Profile) Each participant will interview and write the story of a social, economic, institutional or  policy linked enterprise in India or abroad which involves significant creative element  and  innovative  approach.  Such  profiles  will  require  pooling  of  the  backgrou nd  information interview with the entrepreneur and the team members and in case some  clients have already been served, then interaction with them.  We should also look at  other models in the same domain and try to identify the distinctive features of each. There are three sets of audiences for which recommendations must follow:  One the  entrepreneur,  second  the  policy  makers  and  third  the  support  orgnaisations  which  provide early stage finance and/or mentoring and logistics.   Funding for young really inno vative ideas (sif.sristi.org) The students are encouraged to set up real innovative companies / ventures for which  some seed money will be provided by the faculty/ and or third party students or social  investors  to  trigger  real  outcomes  if  needed.  Techno logical  innovation  based  enterprises will be preferred though other social, cultural and economic enterprises  based on innovative structures or processes are also welcome.  The course will undergo  final layout in the hands of participants in the true tradi tion of user defined and user  based innovation models. All projects and reviews will be put up on the CINE blog  http://cineiima.blogspot.com/ or a new site can be created by the course participants. (Projects) Those students who do not want to set up entr epreneurial ventures can either take up a  project  highlighting  unusual  aspects  of  creativity,  innovations  or  public  policies  or  private initiatives for supporting startups in different parts of the world.   Each participant will also create at least five  to ten pages of open source content, list of  useful links, animations (inRSA style)  or any other useful resource for budding change  agents, social or economic entrepreneurs on a collaborative platform ( Design for online  sanctuary  for  innovations ).  Specif ic  chapters  or  sections  of  different  books  will  be  suggested in class.Some of the readings will make more sense after the class.

We, of course, then know less. If we  don’t do anything about what we know and feel for, we know  even less . Inertia can lull  our sensibilities,perpetual adaptations may give us a choice of being an amoeba! Why do we continue to reinforce the culture of compliance, conformity and congruence  in our society when creativity and innovations demand dissent, diversity and deviance?    How do we learn from four teachers: a teache r within, among each other, common  people and the nature? Are there ways in which every day of life becomes a  shodhyatra,  the learning journey ?  How have different cultures around the world dealt with creative  people and innovation mavericks?  The class wil l set stage for designing ventures, defining markets, forming uncertainty  enclosures ( arenas where what cannot be predicted can only be actualized ....), creating  sanctuaries for start - ups, challenging the existing limits of entrepreneurial space (e.g. if  e very fifth child in school who has gone through or is going through depression or  schizophrenia or other mental health problems, then why cannot service models for  dealing with it be developed for private and government schools. May be some of these  kids a re the budding entrepreneurs or geniuses). To Illustrate, an entrepreneur who  wishes to deal with troubled/alienated childhood will then make a pitch. Action :  Participants will bring examples from their cultural context about dissent, even  whistleblowers, creativity and innovation that they have comeacross.We will also do an  exercise to prove that each one of us is capable of being creative and innovative; it is not  necessarily  an  inborn  or  a  special  trait.  Design  framework  for  developing  products,  platforms, services and networks will then hopefully evolve.   Essential Readings: 1.

Conversely,  why  do  certain  technologies  or  business  processes  remain  unchanged for very long periods? How do  we learn to live with the problems unsolved  indefinitely? How do creative entrepreneurs manage planned obsolescence?

Action :   Each participant will identify three or four situations in which deep inertia has  pers isted whether in our day to day life or in the functioning of organisations and startup  ventures.  The  purpose  is  to  become  conscious  of  the  paradoxical  tension  between  autonomy and agency.  Autonomy implies freedom to act and agency refers to ability and willingness to act.  Sometimes, we have the former and sometimes the latter.  But only in a  few cases, both converge. Essential readings: 1. Do ado, S., &Ventresca, M. J.

Inventory of things, processes and structures, which are in need of urgent innovations: an  inventory of technical, cultural, institutional inertia, but keep the obvious ones  out. How  do we avoid learning to be helpless? Identify the major drivers of entrepreneurial mind  that help to overcome these barriers with alacrity. Action:  Identify the difficulties faced by the startup entrepreneurs and/or managers in  organizations who  have tried to bring about innovative solutions to various problems.  In  a group of two  – three students, shared presentations may be made for three to four  minutes on these barriers.  It will be ideal if these are filled up in a spreadsheet so that  those w hich have already been identified are not repeated unless there is a difference in  the context, scale, domain or the severity of the hurdle.  These hurdles can also be drawn  from the profiles that students are developing of various startup ventures.  The e xamples  of entrepreneurial approaches may also be included. Essential Readings: 1.

In the  earlier years, several examples were discussed including that of Narayan Hrudayalaya,  which achieved world class benchmarks in heart surgery at extraordinarily low cost by  asking different questions.  For instance, Dr. Devi Shetty asked how many of the patients  used air conditioners at home.  Further, does air conditioned room or ward facil itate  early recovery?  The answer was obvious. Majority of the lower middle class patients  didn’t use the air conditioners and the healing was not facilitated by the use of air  conditioners either.  In a 500 - bed hospital, except operation theatre and inten sive care  unit [ICU], rest of the hospital was non air - conditioned.  The cost came down drastically,  so also the hospital induced infection rate.  The participants should search for such  outstanding examples of frugality in design and logistics management.

We  will  also  invite  some  other  professional  innovators  and  entrepreneurs from nearby clusters to share their experie nce in dealing with market,  technological  and  institutional  uncertainties.  Alternatively,  we  can  have  a  panel  discussion with some of the budding startups nominated by the class participants. Action: T he participants will study the background information of his enterprise and look  at all the dimensions of enterprise evolution and development of network.  They will also  identify nascent opportunities for unfolding entrepreneurial potential of a stress pr one  rural  economy.  They  will  have  a  chance  to  interact  with  villagers  in  different  occupationary groups to identify the gaps in the innovation eco system.  If possible, they  will also visit an industrial cluster and interact with technology based entrepre neurs.   January 16, 2017 Sessions 1 3 - 1 4 : 05.40 pm to 08.30pm Lessons from the lives of green frugal innovators  Lessons  based  on  the  experience  of  individual  innovators  at  different  levels  in  the  society, about how they link their ideas, innovations  and institutional choices? We will  also  discuss  cases  of  grassroots  innovators  as  well  as  those  with  professional  background discovered through four Inventors of India workshops (1998 - 2008). Can one become more creative through certain exercises and explo rations? How do we  link individual motivations with triggers, which may lead to taking initiatives, some of  which may eventually become innovations?  How do we factor in the feedback of users  (both potential and actual) in the process?  What do we learn  fr om the innovative  potential of workers in and around the periphery of firms and farms?    Action: Each  participant  will  bring  some  examples  of  shop  floor  innovation,  intra - preneurship, present examples of frugal and green business models.  We can also pla n a  workshop or a panel discussion among some of the frugal innovators. Essential Readings: 1. Pansera, M., & Owen, R. (2014). Eco - Innovation at the “Bottom of the  Pyramid”.

Are  there  any  specific  strategies needed to expand support for more such ventures to come up and succeed.  Action:  P articipants will interview the women headed, and/or managed enterprises apart  from reviewing the literature and draw lessons from them.  Some groups can also look at  the importance of given to women’s ideas in the companies for intra - preneurship purposes. Essential Readings:  1. Gupta, A. K., & Mashelkar, R. A. (2005).

There is a major change taking place in the forms of  organisation for surviving in an uncertain world.  Just as nature has multi functionality,  diversity, frugality, a nd elegance in its working, the entrepreneurial networks have to  have similar qualities.  Bio - mimicry has provided useful lessons from nature just as  other analogs have done so.  Action : The participants will bring examples of creative knowledge and resou rce networks  around the world for making innovation eco system nurturant for startups.  They will  design  the  strategies  for  forming  or  strengthening  the  multi - layer  and  multi - market  networks  for  sharing  knowledge,  resources  and  ideas  for  collective  growth. The  cooperative of entrepreneurs, as an organisational form for generating and reinforcing  synergy will also be pursued .

Factors  such as increasing globalization, co - existence of mature and emerging market within an economy, consistent  growth of information and communication tec hnologies, emergence of new business models,  and  changing role  of the government and civil society in relation to business and non - government organizations have increased  the need for competent change leaders .  I believe that the ability to understand chang e from multiple  perspectives and leverage this understanding to generate contextually sensitive and appropriate decisions and  behavioral patterns is central to change competence. As such, this course introduces participants to  mainstream as well as alterna t ive perspectives on organizational change, encourages them to place these  perspectives in conversation, and criti cally reflect on the underlying  tensions. Through reflexive engagement  with the readings and class activities, the course encourages participa nts to formulate their own approach and  understanding of organizational change.  Course  a dminist ration The course will comprise 20 sessions of 75 minutes each.  There will be a combination of cases, lecture s ,  presentations,  videos, exercises,  class visitors, small group work, guided large group discussions and an  experimental  simulation  designed to provide focus on the dynamics to consider when implementing  organizational change.  Evaluation Participation (20 %) Since this is a class discussion based course, participation is essential. Participation includes active listening to  all partic ipants, giving input into discussions — both  o rally and in writing , and taking part in the simulation in a  manner that enhances your group’s efforts, and preparing and facilitating case discussion or presentations with  your group. You will be graded on your quantity and quality of con tribution. Indicators of quality are effectively  bringing in appropriate concepts from readings, building on others’ ideas, generating new insights to readings,  offering unique or significantly different perspective on an issue, demonstrate reflective thin king, and asking  thought - stimulating questions.  Simulation group reflection paper ( 1 0 %) & individual reflection paper ( 2 0%) In addition to participating in the simulation with your assigned group, you should complete a  4 - page double - spaced reflection  whic h  identif ies the most important event or moment for the group, explain its importance,  and what the group learned from this moment/event for implementing change.  You should also identify the  assumptions, both explicit and implicit, that you collectively m ade and discuss the possible changes in the  assumptions and the potential consequences or change in results.  2 In individual reflection paper ,  you should identify the moments you felt challenged as an individual both while  working wit h the team and during simulation exercise, the skills you used  in your attempt to overcome , why  you could or could not overcome, and how you could have faced these challenges better. We will discuss  in detail in the first session.  Group presentation (20 %) and project - write up (30%) You will follow an o ngoing change in a context that you choose over the period of the course and analyze it. We  will discuss the details in the first session.  Reference text Jick T.D. &  Peiperl, M.A. 2003. Managing change: cases and concepts. McGraw Hill: New York.

The course will provide a broad global pers pective on the working of the media while  explaining specific local elements in developed and developing countries.  The course  would explain the commercial as well as the aesthetic considerations that influence the  functioning of organizations engaged in m ass communications. It would historically  review the way in which  information and communication  technolog ies ha ve  impacted the  mass media and how ethical issues relating to the media have evolved over time. The  course would look at the  ways  in which the in ternet or the worldwide web ha ve  not  merely become an important mass medium in itself but the manner in which the new  medium is exerting a profound influence on  existing media by making these more  personal and participative. The course would also consider the market - oriented, commercial considerations that  impact the mass media which is often perceived to be in contradiction to the role of the  media in providing a public service. The course would introduce students to foundational  works on the political ec onomy of the media while highlighting patterns of interface  between media organizations and society. Specifically, the course would look at the  socially - constructed nature of news that challenges ideas and notions of news as being  something “out there” whi ch is “objective” or “value - free”. It would highlight the  “power” of the media in ideological terms and the corporatization of the media. The  course further examines the practical and pragmatic implications for organizations and  management professionals of the use of fast - changing technologies for mass  communications.

Students will make extensive use of various tools including financial  database s (both paid like  Bloomberg and free data sources like  yahoo finance etc.) , analy tical tools  like  Octave and MS Excel . Some assignments will require writing  snippets of  code (10 - 5 0 lines) . Course Topics: This course will  expose students to fairly complex f inancial modelling across asset classes including  equity, FX, fixed income and commodities for both delta1 and derivatives products. Areas taught in this  course will cover a gamut of cutting - edge financial engineering and modelling applications including: 1. Construction of optimal stock portfolios under varying utility regimes 2. M odelling risk of large equity portfolios using econ omic and statistical techniques 3. Time - series modelling and forecasting volatility (applicable for FX, Commodities & Equities )  – GARCH  family models &  their  extensions 4.

First  2 - 3 hours of the course will  get  you to  speed on  Octave environment  and will  cover all the required programming concepts using  simple examples. 2) All students who take this course  must bring laptops to the classroom. You need to have  Octave installed on your laptop.  F ollowing  packages are  required:  Financial, Optimum &  Econometrics . Software: More than 80% implementation will be done in Octave, which is free open source software,  which allows very similar functionality to MATLAB.  Rest of the implementation will be done in Excel/VBA. You  mus t have Octave installed on your laptop before the first class begins. 1) Download Octave from here and Install it:  https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/windows/ 2) Install Econometrics , Financial  & optim  package s: Read wiki and especially first section on  Installers for Microsoft Windows to correctly install packages. http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Microsoft_Windows 3) Read the wiki before  first class: http://wiki.octave.org/FAQ I will prepare an installation manual and send it around a week before class starts. It will help you in  correctly installing Octave and all the requi red packages. In case, you still have questions, you can email  me or take help from institute’s systems  team . Evaluation &  Grading: Financial modelling and empirical work will be needed both in classroom and in form of assignments .  Assignments will be  designed to give you an opportunity to implement models studied in the class. Since this is a n industry focused hands - on  modelling course, there will be no mid - term and end - term  exams. Rather, t here will be  a  group project involving substantial empirical w ork . Ideal group size is  2  students, however if you want to have 3  members in your team, it is OK. Grading will be on following  criteria: 1) Five Assignments  of  10 % each for – 5 0% 2) In - Class Performance – 10 % 3) Empirical  P roject – 3 0 % 4) Quiz  (Mini - Exam) – 10% To get an A+ in the project, your project needs to be good enough to get published in a student finance  journal.

In 1500,  the centre of gravity of world business was firmly located between the Indian Ocean World and  the Mediterranean Basin. Over the next five hundred years, the locus shifted to Western Europe  and North America. Why and how did this happen? Who were the key actors behin d these  changes? What type of firms and business practices emerged across the world? This course  addresses these questions and enables one to understand the evolution of firms, industries and  economies over the long run.  Understanding seismic shifts of the past broadens the horizon of the management professional  and provides skills to better understand the future.  The course is divided in four parts. Part 1 provides overviews of three global revolutions - scientific, impe rial and industrial  – that gave birth to the modern world and its interconnections  with business and economic history. Part 2 reviews key actors in global business history. Part 3  highlights the origins of business practices by considering the histories of specific firms and  sectors. Against the backdrop of the global revolutions, key actors and business practices, Part 4  traces  the  business  and  economic  histories  of  regions  across  the  world  in  comparative  perspective.  Part 1: Global Revolutions, 1500 - 200 0: Introduction, The Scientific Revolution, The Imperial Revolution, The Industrial Revolution Part 2: People: Merchants, Entrepreneurs, Managers, Labourers, Women Part 3: Firms and Business Practices: The Joint Stock Firm (English East India  Company), Modern Management, Mass Production &  Marketing (Ford and General Motors), Big Business - Mergers & Acquisitions, Modern Finance  (Lehman Brothers) Part 4: Regions: US, UK, Germany & Japan; China and India; Russia and Europe; Africa and the Middle  East;  Latin America, East Asia and Rest of the World Course  Objective :  To understand the evolution of modern business and economies in global perspective   To comprehend the global revolutions, actors, business practices and regional business  and economic histories across five centuries  Pedagogy : The course will be taught through interactive sessions with class room discussions, group  exercises and presentations. Cases, scholarly articles, background reading notes, adapted card  games and visual media will be used in the course. Evaluation Scheme :  The break - up of the evaluation scheme is as follows: Class Participation: 16%, Assignment: 42%, Group Presentations (2): 42% Assignment will be based on aspects of business and economic history related with  either  individuals, firms, industries or regions.

Hospitals play a very important role in the delivery of healthcare services. With advances in  the filed of medicine, hospitals are able to offer a wide variety of healt hcare services.   Hospitals depend on modern technology, consume large amount of resources, and have thus  become very complex organizations. Hospital management has assumed added significance  in the light of increased cost for medical care, aging population and the potentially declining  levels of service, all of which threaten the quality of service delivered. Liberalization of  insurance sector has added a new dimension to the delivery and pricing of healthcare  services. Poor quality of service not only wast es resources but is positively dangerous to the  health and welfare of the patients and the community at large. Hospital administrators/  managers therefore need a certain amount of professional management inputs so as to  manage hospitals effectively and eff iciently.

Siddhartha Saxena (Wing 8, Extn. 4872) (Wing 12, Extn. 4920) pgupta@iimahd.ernet.in siddharthas@iimahd.ernet.in Introduction Importance of teams is well recognized. Team work is part of one’s life. Business, Industry,  Government, Films, Sports, Medicine - any field requires one to e ither be a team player or a  team leader. Nevertheless, building a high performing team is complex and challenging. There  is a lot of literature on various aspects of teams and team work. Using this literature, the course  attempts to provide experience base d learning opportunity to the participants. Objective The main objective of the course is to let the participant s experience the dynamics of team  work and understand what is required to be able to perform well as team player s and as team  leader s . The  participant s also learn conceptual lessons from successful experiences with teams  and team work from various fields from the public, private, and services sectors.  The course also aims at providing insights into the team behaviour by focusing on one’s own self through a series of classroom tests, exercises, and hands - on experiences. Pedagogy The course will use the following methods of learning:  (i) Experiential learning through project  work , (ii) Conceptual sessions backed with case studies, classroom exercises and readings, and  (iii) Experience sharing sessions with practitioners from various fields. These are detailed below.  i. Exploring team dynamics through e xperiential learning using  p roject wo rk: The class will  be divided into teams. Each team will work on a project. The projects will be decided by  the respective teams in consultation with the Instructor. Each team will work on a  project  and  implement  it  during  the  course  while  maintaining  deta iled  log  of  the  activities  undertaken  and  write  a  report.  Each  team  will  prepare  a  report  on  its  experiences as a team. Each member will write an introspective report on the lessons  learnt about self on team work. ii. Conceptual sessions along with classroom  e xercises: There will be conceptual sessions  along  with  exercises  and  case  studies  to  understand  what  matters  in  building high  performing teams. The case studies will be drawn from local as well as global contexts.  iii. Experience sharing from different fields on high performing teams and team work from  people of diverse backgrounds.

Agarwal Instructor: Prof. Anurag K. Agarwal Office: Wing 12F Tel: 4916, 9898390722 akagarwal@iima.ac.in Secretary:  Ms. Sarala Nair Office: Wing 10 Tel: 4595 sarala@iima.ac.in Academic Associate: Course Objective:  Enterprises, the world over, now conduct business on a dramatically more international scale,  which results in  trans - border disputes and conflict of laws. Speedy resolution of business disputes is imperative to prevent  diffusion of corporate resources in avoidable litigation, which is notorious globally for costing a lot in terms of  both time and m oney. In certain jurisdictions the situation is reaching a standstill. Business leaders should spend  more time on their business rather than in courts of law. It is precisely because of this reason they need to know  the methods of Alternative Dispute Resol ution (ADR)  – arbitration, conciliation, mediation, negotiation and a  mix  of  these.  One  method  of  choice  for  settlement  of  business  disputes  is  the  ‘international  commercial  arbitration’, which is popular all over the world and has stood the test of the ti me. It is increasingly used as the  method of dispute resolution in almost all the contracts  – construction, supply of goods, employer - employee  contracts, etc. The course focuses on international commercial arbitration and also covers other methods of  ADR. Course Objective:  - Provide  an  opportunity  to  business  students  to  have  an  exposure  to  the  legal  aspects  of  dispute  resolution.  - To make the students understand the importance of dispute resolution through alternative methods vis - à - vis litigation. - Make  the students aware of the potency of international commercial arbitration and also the limitations Pedagogy:  Emphasis shall be on discussion of cases, i.e., judgments delivered by different courts and tribunals. These  include the US Supreme Court, the  House of Lords, International Chamber of Commerce, Paris, Supreme Court  of India, etc. Brief lectures would be delivered to provide an overview and summarise important aspects. Number of sessions: Total number of sessions is 20 Prerequisites and Eligibility, if any, and their Justification:  Though knowledge of law, particularly contracts and arbitration, is helpful, yet not a prerequisite.  Restriction on Class Size, if any, and their Justification:  None.  Relationship of the Course with the Overall Programme Objective and Related Courses: It is a general course which is relevant for all businesses. The course dovetails with the overall PGP curriculum and  relates to the compulsory course LAB. Bibliography: (A) Essential Reading: - Contracts and Arbitration for Managers by Anurag K. Agarwal, Sage, 2016 - Course Pack: As new judgments are delivered by various courts from time to time, the  cases may be updated. - New York Convention, 1958 - Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - Judgments available at westlaw.com  (B) Additional Reading: - International Commercial Arbitration by von Mehren, Varady and Barcelo - Russell on Arbitration - Arbitration by S D Singh - Indian Council of Arbitration Journal - Lates t developments (international and domestic) Computer Centre Facilities and other Special Infrastructure Needed: Access to  westlaw.com , and other law related websites.

News Clippings An integral part of this course will be updating on important current events which pertain to business disputes,  both domestic and international. There is a deluge of such news a nd views in the print and electronic media,  which makes sifting all the more necessary. My endeavour will be to share with you a couple of selected news  clippings. This is in no way meant to supplant your own initiative. You are encouraged to keep yourself abreast  with the latest through an economic daily and an international weekly / fortnightly. The more you read the  better. The following is an illustrative list: The Times of India, The Hindu, The Economic Times, NYT, The  Financial Times, The BusinessWeek , The Time, The Economist, etc. I will share with you relevant news clippings and you are requested to share with me and the fellow students any  news item, article, etc. which you feel is important, interesting and topical. You may send the web link by em ail  or provide the hardcopy to me for distribution to the entire class. I look forward to receiving your suggestions  and contributions.

PGP2 Elective 2016 - 1 7 Instructors: Mr Apurv Nagpal Prof. Arvind Sahay Corporate Guests Camillo Pane, CEO, Coty Marketing Director, Coty (TBC) Global Category Head  (Fragrances), TBC Learning on the job, wit h a  corporate  presenting an innovation need they currently face ,  with key  people from the company being present in most classes,  is a strong way that  student s can get  exposed to what is involved in coming up with a new product or service . Innovation doesn’t  necessarily involve rules or a specific order of steps, as each situation is different.  Also , going with a  live case ensures there is minimal data spoon - fed to the students,  just  as in real corporate life.  This  methodology will also rely less on reading materials and more on  in - classroom activity and group  homework for some sessions The idea is to 1. Have senior personnel, from a top corpor ates, to come and present an innovation need they  are experiencing.  Coty, especially after the acquis ition of P&G’s fragrance range is one of the  world’s largest beauty care companies and the largest in fragrances. We will be focusing on  the fragrance category for the students.  2. To have a different corporate every year, spanning various fields, like FMCG, finance,  engineering, media & entertainment, to dotcom 3. The corporate would  also  benefit by having some of the brightest young minds in the country  working on their pro blem Course Objectives The course is designed 1. To let  the  participant develop  the  ability  to  come  up  with  out  of  the  box  solutions,  innovations  by understanding the broad process, rather than  a set pattern of steps. While each  step will be talked about, different cases will involve a different level of emphasis, depending  o n the case.  2. To develop and enhance participant’s concept writing and market research skills 3. To help  students  understand  different  innovation  methodologies,  corporate decision making processes Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to: 1. Be able to don an innovators hat, understand the process of innovation and the barriers  against it which exist in most workplaces 2. Have the ability to focus marketing skills, learnt in the previous year, towards finalizing and  launching a new product o r service  Linkage with Other Courses IIMA Confidential – please do not cite or quote without permission 3 The course takes off from first year marketing courses and relies on  relevant basic knowledge of concept writing, consumer insights and market research Relevance of the Course Most companies today are ranked,  valued on their ability to innovate. Companies which have  complicate d innovation processes , have fallen by the wayside (Reckitt & Colman, Kodak) while those  with streamlined  systems (3M, Benckiser) have managed to make a mark even when facing giant  competi tors Required  Materials  1.  Eighteen Plus Duets :  by  Apurv Nagpal , coauthored with 18 different women :  an innovative book  – self - published, with various innovations designed to shake - up the world of publishing  As given in the course outline later About  The Faculty Apurv Nagpal Apurv, PGP ’93, has worked in companies like P&G,  BAT,  Reckitt Benckiser, SABMiller and was last  Managing Director of Saregama (formerly known as HMV, operating in Media and Entertainment) . Right  from early corporate years he was  exposed to and led various innovation projects – including heading  innovations globally for RB for their flagship category of Auto - Dish (> $1 bn sales). He has worked in  India and abroad (Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Russia, UK, Holland) in global roles as well  as operational  ones. He is currently a keen traveler, blogger, speaker at various forums and an author, based out of  Pune. Prof Arvind Sahay Professor Sahay, PGP ’89, joined IIMA in June 2004 from London Business School where he had been  teaching since hi s Ph.D. in 1996 from the University of Texas at Austin. His areas of interest include  marketing strategy, pricing, high tech marketing, international trade and investment, strategic  management, brand management and valuation and tracking organizational per formance on multiple  dimensions. At IIMA, he teaches the basic marketing courses on the PGP, PGPX and PGP - PMP  programs. In addition, he offers elective courses on pricing, international trade, marketing of financial  services, tracking organizational perfor mance and brand management and valuation. His corporate  experience includes stints as a management trainee in the manufacturing sector and as a customer  service and then account manager in the financial services industry. Pedagogy o Case and Class Discussions There will be minimal case material, with reliance on the in - classroom activity, with the corporate being present in every class to explain what the  innovation brief is about, set the parameters ,  answer questions .   o Group Activity  The entir e project is group based, with the class being split into groups right after the innovation brief is  laid out in session two.  There will be two group activities which will be conducted during the class,  brainstorming and shortlisting ideas .  o Lecture/Discussions These sessions will allow us to examine different philosophies, methods of innovation,  the different corporate philosophies, especially of companies renowned for their  innovation.  o Participant Limit . Participation will be limited to a total of 48 students , minimum 24 students  needed with groups of 5 - 6 students IIMA Confidential – please do not cite or quote without permission 4 Evaluation  C  lass P articipation 4 0% Brainstorm (Group) 10 % Video Diary (one only per student) ((Individual 20% F inal Concept s Presented 3 0% Class Participation: There  will be a high degree of reliance on class participation and  group activities. You will be evaluated on the quality of your contribution. Participation that builds on the discussion in the class tends to be the most effective. Please be prepared to be cold called in the class. A minimum attendance of 80% of the sessions is required , with attendance  of the first 6 sessions mandatory – otherwise you will get an F on the course. Class participation which displays a lack of preparation or is completely tangential to the discussion in class will get negative marks. You are required to have a name tag in front of you every single class day – this is mandatory. The instructors reserve the right to change the weightage given to a particular session for CP as required. Strictly no mobile phone or laptop usage  is allowed in class o Academic Dishonesty: Any instance of academic dishonesty will lead to an automatic F on the course. Note: This is a course which focuses not so much on theory, but more on teaching via a  live innovation need currently being faced by well known corporates. Key is to be able  to understand the different steps, participate in the process and come up with a final,  acceptable solution, w hich will need to be presented to the corporate.  Other 1. T he course should be held over  4 - 5 weeks  – in January, with a small overlap into Feb 2. Sess ions  to be held together (back to back) , in a single day are marked as such, with  appropriate colour coding 3. Students will also send their top concepts into market research with the corporate’s research  prov ider and receive and analyse results. The research methodology chosen could be  qualitative or quantitative, depending on the innovation need.  Which is why a g ap between  the  time concepts are submitted by students (session 13) and the time the qualitative happens  (session 16, 17) and quantitative (session 18).  4.

The main objective of this course is to provide a thorough understanding of  international trade and how models have developed to explain why nations trade,  and what impact tra de has on welfare of participating countries. In addition, there  will be a strong emphasis on empirical studies that either corroborate or dispute  the predictions of these models . Finally, we will delve into instruments of trad e  policy, placing trade in a political context, especially that of developing countries.

The  toughest decisions  within  organizations  are not  the  result of  “rational /logical ” analysis . These decisions  are a result of  answers to multiple questions bordering on what is right and what is wrong.  Strangely and  ironically , the y cannot be  clearly  compartmentalized or  categorized as “right” or “wrong”.  As a manager, y ou too will face similar situation s, in which  you have to take a tough  decision . Notwithstanding the circumstances, your dilemma will deepen as you will  take  difficult decision s involving a choice between  right and right and  wrong and wron g. The choice will call  for  a  compromise. Additi o nally , you will also need to assess the situation and  respond to the following questions: what is the  difference between a sound compromise and  a sell out? When do ethical ends justify dubious means? When do you take a stand? These  are only some of the questions that  you , as a manager , will face .  However, as you  progress from the role of a manager to a leader, these very questions will test your mettle. You will reflect  and look for appropriate answers to th ese key questions and in the process  realise that there are some other questions which  simultaneously need to be addressed:  What is leadership? How is a leader different from a manager? How does one prepare to  become a leader? Does a leader  have a vision?  Does a leader share a vision?  What is  meant by vision?  Do you  d are to dream?  When  can/ do you dream and when do you come  face to face with  ground realities? Is it  worthwhile  to dream for  a seemingly  unrealistic  vision? Or is it better to be “practical” and  choose  “ not to be ” ? Is a leader just a hero? What  is the difference between success and satisfaction? When is ambition a propelling, creative  force and when does it become destructive?  The list is endless and these are only  some of  the  questions that  need  to be resolved by  students aspiring to be leaders. This course, or for that matter, any course, cannot, by itself, provide answers to these  questions . This course  helps you to debate, discuss,  develop a per spective and  seeks to  provide an opportunity to d evelop a deeper understanding of the dilemmas, complexities  and subtleties of responsible leadership. It provides an opportunity to think, reflect and  expand your mental horizon. It trains you to ask questions for which you know there are no  textbook and  c oncrete answers.  Asking these  questions, debat ing on issues and arriving  at  responses that help develop judgement which  stimulate s the  senses  and  enable s you to  consider issues in the right  perspective. In short, the course  seeks to enable you to take not  more correct decisions, but better decisions (hopefully!). 2 Another important contr ibution of the course is that it w ill introduce  you to the world of  literature and show how to interpret great works of literature and draw lessons from them.  Literature  i s not  only  fascinating  to  read  (especially  when  it  is  not  to  be  read  for  examinations in degree courses!) but also immensely rewarding in the process of self  development. Objectives : 1. To understand key concepts in leadership such as  decision making, v ision, illusion,  meaning,  reality,  myths, legends, symbols, rituals, beliefs, values, attitudes, will,  ambition, virtue, responsibility, cleverness, intrigue, jealousy, personality, roles etc.  with  input from  humanities . 2. To use such concepts in underst and ing the  role of  leadership and  impact of  culture  on modern organizational life. 3. To  understand  r elationships  between  organizational  needs,  role  demands  and  personality differences, and  4. To develop skills for selecting and interpreting great works of literature so as to learn  meaningfully from humanities  for  leadership role s . Pedagogy The course approaches the whole topic of leadership through a study of literature. Why  literature? Many works of literature give glimpses of different aspects of le adership. They  present the dilemmas of life. In many of the literary pieces  you will read in this course, you  will not find clear, inspiring tales of heroism or sainthood, although in some readings there  are. Many of the characters  in these works are simpl e  people like you and me, with  strengths and flaws. They are, in Nietzsche’s phrase, “human, all too human”. That is why  they  reflect  life  in  its  true  reality.  These  works  of  literature will  puzzle,  fascinate  and  challenge you to interpret the situation an d the characters in as  conservative or radical a  manner as possible.  Interpretation forms the essence of the course. These pieces of literature give insights into  the thoughts and feelings of  common and lofty people who are either leaders or are on the  p ath to attaining leadership positions with common follies but great successes and failures …  narrated /presented in a highly readable  and fascinating style. In this course, students will form study groups of three to five and each group will take up at  le ast one work and analyse it fully, reflect over it and present their understandings to the  class. But before doing so, t hey have to meet the instructor , as a group, at least one day  prior to the class and discuss what they propose to present in  class. Thes e presentations  will be for about 20 to 30 minutes, followed by discussions and supplementary inputs by  the  instructor .  3 The class discussions tend to become quite interesting, with novel  ideas and  points of view  presented with a new perspective . Interest ingly, m ost students  attending the course  are  quite astonished at their own  ability to  understand an d interpret literature and see its relevance for  gaining a holistic perspective of diverse situations, a must for all  managers  and leaders. Two films , “The Making of the Mahatma”  and  “Les Miserables”  will form a  part of the  course. In case you all think that there is a film which portrays leadership qualities, we can  screen the same.   These sessions  in which we will screen additional films , based on interes t  levels, will be  purely optional and outside the main course outline.  The films are  NOT a  substitute for the main readings. Grading Scheme The following will be the grading scheme followed: 15% Class Presentations :  T he presentations made by the vari ous groups will be evaluated on  (i) the quality of their interpretation (rather than merely summarising the reading) (ii) the issues generated for discussions and  (iii) the innovative elements introduced to make the presentations more effective.  This will be a group  grade in which all the members of a group will receive the same  grade, unless there are good reasons to believe that some of the members have not  contributed at all or only in an  insignificant way to the group output. 20% Individual class participation a nd attendance: This will be based on the  interest taken in the class and the quality of contributions to the discussions. 25%  End - term Project : The project  will be a group effort, and could be on any of the  topics on leadership, maybe one of those covered in the class, maybe not.  The  output can be in the form of a written report or a short film.  They could be based on a  theme encompassing more than one reading given in the class or other material, or  they could be a detailed reflective elaboration on one o f the readings done in the  class, including the presentation made in the class and the discussions. The grade  will be a group grade. 40% End Term Examination: This could be either of the class room, or take home  type. Of course, this will be an individual evaluation. 4 COURSE OUTLINE Sessions 1. Management Education and Humanities  a ) Singh, S P (1998). “Two Organiz ational Roles: Manager's and Leader's , ”  Vikalpa ,  Ju ly - September, 23(3), 55 - 61 . b ) Collins and Porras ( 1995) . “More Than Prof its” Chapter III. In  Built to Last:  Successful Habits of  Visionary Companies ,  London: Century. The first session set s the stage for the course and dwell s upon the distinctions  between  managers  and  leaders,  role  of  values  and  is a  “ how  to ” guide  for  appreciating literature. 2 . Leaders in the Making Film : “The Making of the Mahatma”.  This film traces the process of development of an ordinary boy named M.K. Gandhi  into a Mahatma .  How he became a leader, and what dilemmas  he faced are vividly  brought  out  in this film. 3. Discussion on the Film 4. Dreams and Reality Cervantes: Don Quixote Sheldon  Kopp : Tale of a Mad Knight Excerpts from Ortega's Meditations on Quixote Don Quixote is a synonym for the eccentric , “unrealistic” dreamer who lives in his  own world. But the class raises the question: Would the world be much better without  such dreamers and cranks? Who is in fact the dreamer and who, the realist? Why  does this eccentric inspire the world today so much so that  the novel  continues to be  translated into a record number of languages, and people continue to read it a nd still  fe e l nothing but affection for this mad knight? 5. Heroism and Martyrdom George Bernard Shaw: Saint Joan Joan d’Arc is the perso n best known for rousing the French as a nation and goading  a Dauphin utterly without self respect into the King of France. What do we learn from  this heretic turned Saint? 6. Vision and Action Girish Karnad: Tughlak 5 Here is another dreamer, another  visionary. But why do we feel so different towards  him as compared  to  for example , Joan or Don Quixote?  What are the qualities he  possesses?  Does he  possess  any  such quality/qualities that led to his failure, an d  prevent ed him from becoming a leader who  c ould command respect rather than  fear? 7. Ends and Means Vishakadatta : The Signet Ring of Rakshasa Chanakya has fascinated people for the last two centuries. For him, end s justified the  means. No holds barred. Yet he comes as a sharp contrast  to  Tug hlaq. Why? In this  immortal play, we look at  the question: do  ends justify means or means justify ends ? 8 . Freedom and Social Responsibility Brecht: Life of Galileo Galileo was threatened to be burnt at the stake for his view that challenged the  bel iefs of the Church. He recanted and led a life devoted to further advances in  physics which did not offend the church. What is the responsibility of the leader when  it comes to personal choices? Did Galileo sell out or did he choose a course of action  that led to a better world, all things considered? 9. Power and Ploy Sun Tzu: Art of War This book written about 2500 years ago is probably the most widely translated and  read book in military schools, and of late in business schools. While it tells you how  to compete it also tells you a whole lot on how not to compete. 1 0 . Power and Greed Shakespeare:  Macbeth In this play ‘power’ and ‘greed’ are closely intertwined. Can power be wrested or  vested? Does power beget greed for more power? In this viciou s cycle, how do  leaders operate? Do they become power centric or power hungry? Do they forget the  cause of their followers in the search for the unattainable? 11 . Private versus Public Life Arthur Miller: All My Sons Capitalism has its ugly side. It  is never uglier than when it forces people to take  decisions endangering others’ lives. But some of these lives may be those of the  near and dear. How do leaders take decisions that need a choice between what  organizations demand and what they want to do?  In this powerful play by Arthur  Miller, we explore many of these uncomfortable issues. 6 1 2 .    Taking a Stan d Ibsen: Antigone In this classic Greek play by Sophocles, two inflexible characters take positions and  their positions are irreconcilab le. It leads to a tragic series of events Greek tragedies  are famous for. What were the  real  issues they were taking a stand for? Could they  have achieved those yet reconciling with the other person’s viewpoint? Or are ideals,  by their very nature, incapab le of any compromise? These issues arise when one  takes  a  stand  on  a  matter of principle, and this play beautifully brings out the  complexities involved in resolving them. 13. Moral and Amoral Judgement Conrad:  The Secret Sharer In this novel we explor e the dilemmas a leader faces in making a judgement. Should  all judgements be moral or can some also  be  ‘amoral’,  and yet correct? Who decides  what is right? Does one need societal consensus or can one foll o w  one’s instinct and  conscience? What is right an d what is wrong? Is there a dividing line?  14.       Ambition and Purpose Achebe: Things Fall Apart In this novel set in Africa, we explore the raw ambitions of a man which still lead him  nowhere. We explore such questions as: What is character? What i s ambition?  When does it become all destroying?  15.      Change and transformation Film : “Les Miserables” The film explores the theme of change and transformation of a convict, Jean Valjean.  The dilemmas he faces as he moves in life from being a misant hropic to a man  capable of self sacrifice, how and where does he find inspiration, the moral trials he  faces are well captured in the film.  16.      Discussion on the Film 1 7 . Ideals and Reality  - I Iravati Karve: Yuganta,  Chapters “Final Effort” (on Bhi shma), Kunti and Draupadi. 1 8 . Ideals and Reality  - II Iravati Karve: Yuganta,  Chapters on Karna, Ashwathama (Paradharmo) and Krishna. S essions  17  and  18  are  based  on  an  interpretation  of  the  immortal  classic,  Mahabharatha by Irawati Karve. We come acro ss the famous characters such as  Bhishma, Kunti, Draupadi, Karna , Ashwathama and Krishna. Everyone has his or her  7 own flaws. But how does one keep these flaws under control? How does one  achieve a perspective and a balance between ends and means? These are the  themes explored in the play. No one forgets the interpretations of the characters in  the play, especially that of Krishna, the master strategist. 19.  Success and Satisfaction Bokil: Thirsting for Water Success is one thing. Satisfaction is wh olly different. They are neither mutually  exclusive nor necessary complements. In the short story, we explore the makings of  a leader who  attains the position  almost by accident, but who  is able to derive satisfaction. We contrast her to another character  in the story who is outwardly  successful. 2 0 . Self and Ethics Bimalk ar: Satyadas In this powerful short story, we explore the meaning of ethics, self respect and the  way one gets rich but gets degraded in the process. It raises powerful questions on  the meaning of the term character. 21.       Guest Lecture 2 2 .

C hakrabarti (Ext . - 4385 ) Intended audience:  PGP - I I , 2015 - 16  (term - VI, elective) I. Course Description : This is a  concise  course on  macro economics of India  from an applied  perspective . The objective is to build an overview of the current policy debates on the Indian  economy and challenges ahead. The main take away for the participants would be broad  assessment of a country’s economic growth story with multitudes of factors and uncertainties  surrounding it s busin ess environment . The course participants will be introduced to the nuances of the Indian  growth  experience,  unstable relationships between inequal ity and growth, heterogeneity of the Indian economy,  boom in the service sector as a global phenomenon, fiscal and monetary policies in India in  comparison to the  developed world and finally India’s transition to market democracy and its  pitfalls. For  this,  we  rely  to  a  great  extent  on  analyzing  economic  data  of multiple  countries  and  consider various types of factors and channels that potentially affected the Indian economy  (and the developing world in general).  We will apply the  fundamental  models developed in the  basic microeconomics  ( M E ) and macroeconomics course (ME P) to equip the participants to  understand  the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment in India and formulate  policy  responses by taking cue from the glob al experience. It will be most useful for management  profession al s and consultants who  are interested in the Ind ian economy. II.

Modern  managers  in  a  number  of  sectors  are  increasingly incorporating econometric applications into their businesses to establish  sound  e conomic  strategies,  to  develop  insight,  create  value,  and  outperform  competition.  Econometric applications provide organisations with a potent set of tools to unlock the power  of information and in effective decision making. Therefore, it is imperative that  management  students have basic grounding on Econometric analysis before handling real life problems. In PGP 1, under Quantitative Methods (Part 1 and 2), students  a re introduce d to the  basic concept s of probabilit y and its applications , notions of  s ampling,  p oint and  i nterval  e stimation,  t esting of  h ypotheses,  a nalysis of  v ariance,  basic framework of regression, etc. Building over this foundation, the main objective of the course is to introduce Econometrics  as a decision making tool purely from application point of view. Towards this, the course  aims at developing adequate understanding of regression methodology and  showcases various  applications  to  real  life problems.  Beginning with  the very nature of Econometrics and  economic data, we highlight  some important real life problems upfront so as to ignite the  problem solving  ability of young managers through Econometr ics.  Following two sessions  (Module 1) aim at recapitulating some of the basics  concepts of regression from  a more  applied context.  Subsequent sessions take regression methodology forward by questioning  some of the fundamental assumptions , without going  into the detailed technical stuff of  regression methodology . What happens when basic assumptions like linearity, homoscedastic  errors, causality, etc., are violated and what are the various tweaks to the data that enable us  to overcome such issues forms th e crux of Modules 2 and 3. Again all these issues are  covered through various examples. The discussion in Modules 1  – 3 is typically restricted to  cross - sectional data and an introduction to regression is not complete without discussing time  series data in a greater detail.  Time series data comes with additional  issues like stationarity, trend, seasonality,  cyclicality, etc.  Module 4 is aimed at providing greater understanding of  how to deal with such data. We conclude in Module 5 by discussing panel data where the  data is both cross - sectional as well as time series in nature . In the process of teaching, we will introduce various data sets .  The p rimary idea is to  understand the power of data analysis and  to demonstrate some of the concepts  which are  cove red in the class.  They  will  cover w ide range of topics including finance, marketing ,  politics, policy evaluation and HR. On top of that, we  shall  encourage  students  to come up  with examples of application of regression in areas of  their interest.  There is a software  component to this course.  We will use Excel  as well as  more advanced statistical software  like STATA and E V iews for the course . So students will have benefit to learn the basic s of  STATA  and EViews  as well. Prerequisite for this  course is  the understanding of basic  statistics. However, the desire to learn a  technical  tool which is increasingly used in today’s  world to address real life problems is essential.

K. Sinha, Wing 10, Phone: 4892 Academic Associate :  Introduction Consumer shop from different channels based on the values that they derive from each of the  formats.  Stores  formats  are  chosen  based  on  availability,  accessibility,  ambience  and  affordability. It also depends on the cost of shopping tasks. It is found that consumers tend to  choose new formats like online based on cognitive factors as compared to established formats  like Kirana which are chosen with more affect. Studies indicate that adoption of formats  depended on the order of entry too. With online retail ing cutting across territories as independent e - commerce retailer or as a part  of a brand or physical retailer, the consumer have started shopping differently in terms of  their search behaviour, product delivery, purchase and shipping. They expect a seamle ss  expertise across the formats. This has posed a new challenge for the companies and retailer in  terms of profitability and customer migration. Companies need to look at retailing in a new  perspective. Retailing as a business has its own dimensions.  A re tailer has to look at its busin ess more  minutely at a more dis aggregate level. Every transaction counts, every SKU counts, every  customer  counts.  It  is also  found that  customers  behave differently while  shopping  with  respect to products, service and promot ions at  different  retail  formats even when buying the  same brands. Attitudes and plans have been found to be influenced by retailers, making the  choice in favour of their promoted brands as against the context brands of the consumers. The retail sector in India is undergoing significant transition. With the entry of large scale  retailing and online , as well as marked improvement in offering a 'shopping' experience to  customers, marketers are beginning to look at the role of retailing as a brand with a pote ntial  to influence a value chain, rather than being an outcome of a value chain.  However, in spite  Prof. Piyush Kumar Sinha Page  2 of  6 of this trend, the bulk of retailing activity in the country is (and will remain) in the semi - organised and unorganised sectors. In this context,  this cour se focuses  on  managing retail as a business with several formats  working symbiotically to deliver the desired results .  O bjectives The objective of the course is to expose students to  the field of managing  omni  retailing ,  defined as an  activity that  ensures final delivery of products and services to the end customer across different formats . The perspectives, therefore, would be from both the principal (in  terms of managing retailing) and the retail businessperson (in terms of managing the retail  busi ness) in the context of a customer shopping from a combination of formats with each of  them playing different roles in the process of buying .  Pedagogy The  course  would  utilise  a  mix  of  in - class  and  project  learning  methods  including  (i)  presentations  an d  discussions  led  by  instructors,  (ii)  project  work  and  presentations  by  students,  (iii)  case  discussions  and  (iv)  presentations  and  discussion  led  by  guest  faculty  (principals,  retailers  and  consultants).  The  project  would  involve  field/store  study  to  get necessary data.  The presentations of the project work and class participation will be an  important  element  of  the  course.  In  each  case  session, the  participants  are  expected to  analyse, discuss, and suggest suitable course of action for the situation in  the assigned case.  Equally important would be the task of understanding concepts and ideas from the readings  and articles given to the participants.

They are  among the  fastest growing companies, both in terms of  revenue and profits . In India,  four of the top ten companies  are in the business of energy  exploration,  production  and/ or distribution .  Apart from the conventional  energy businesses,  new  avenues have  also  opened up in fiel ds of alternative energy supply ,  smart grids and energy services.  Energy b usinesses  face unique challenges .  T he  demand for energy is on the rise,  conventional  fossil fuel stocks  are uncertain  and  depleting , and  there is a global imperative to  reduce the  emissions of greenhouse gases. Since the energy busines s es often transcend national borders,  they are exposed to global risk s from geopolitics, financial and environmental market dynamics. Objectives The course aims to  introduce how the  global  energy  business es are evolving , what risks they face  and how do  they respond to the changing  competitive  dynamics marked by scalability,  diversification and integration .  The focus will be to identify solutions that can integrate  energy  business concerns with  environmental,  socio - economic , technological and  geo political considerations.  The course  will also discuss  recent advances  and emerging business opportunities  in :i)  new and  renewable energy technolog y markets , ii)energy services businesses focusing on  the  demand - side  efficiency(e.g.  lighting , appliances,  automobile), i ii ) entrepreneurship and risk  finance  and  i v) integrated energy and environment solutions  (e.g.  infrastructure s, ICT solutions).

For instance, in India, hydro power provides a  quarter of total energy generated, while water use in  agriculture consumes a quarter of national  electricity  consumption. Hydro power is one of the cleanest energy  resources and provides good peaking load management. On  the other hand, water is also a necessary resource required in  abundance to produce new energy resources such as shale  gas, tight gas , and coal - bed methane using hydraulic  fracturing. These are raising concerns on extracting these  new energy resources all over the world.  Case: Caprica Energy and its choices, Darden  Business Publishing (2011)  DM: Withdrawing water from an aquifer: The  economics, Darden Business Publishing (2014) 6 Module  4 : Innovation and Market Expansion : The Business of Energy Services  As energy prices are rising, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the saving potential  from end - use energy efficiency enhance ment.

The fall of the “rational economic ma n”  –  thirty years in the making  – finally being buried in the aftermath of the global financial crisis is now leading to new insights on  consumer behavior that have a direct impact on how marketers should be developing their marketing  plans and implementin g them. This course  –  amongst the first of its kind  –  seeks to build on the  emerging knowledge in this field with its applications in the area of consumer behavior.  Course Objectives The course is designed  1. To develop the participant’s basic knowled ge of the human brain and how it takes decisions  based around the themes of “thinking and feeling,” greed, prediction, confidence, risk, fear,  surprise,  regret  and  happiness;  how  the  brain  receives  stimuli,  processes  them  and  the  responses that it generate s.  2. To develop and enhance participant’s analytical skills, conceptual abilities and substantive  knowledge  in  the  field  of  consumer  behaviour  based  on  inputs  from  neuroscience  and  behavioral decision theories. 3. To develop a roadmap for applying the knowledg e of neuroscience and consumer behavior in  different marketing and business contexts.  Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to: 1. Distinctly enhance your knowledge of consumer behaviour beyond what you learnt in the first  year core  marketing courses. This includes the ability to explain and apply the (key) terms,  definitions, and concepts used in the study of neuroscience and consumer behaviour.  2. Demonstrate how as a marketer you can use your enhanced knowledge of consumer behaviour concepts and related methodology, and greater sensitivity to consumer psychology to develop  better marketing programs and strategies  –  especially in the last mile in the marketplace where  consumers make decisions.  Linkage with Other Courses The cour se takes off from the first year marketing courses MM1 and MM2 in particular.  The course  will also assume relevant basic knowledge of micro - economics (price elasticity, demand and supply)  IIMA Confidential  –  please do not cite or quote without permission 2 and psychology (attribution, perception).  The course has little or  no overlap with other existing  elective courses in the marketing, strategy, economics and organizational behavior areas.  Relevance of the Course Neuroscience and neuro - economics are increasingly fundamental to our understanding of business and  consume r decisions. Research in neuroscience over the past 10 years has added new dimensions to our  understanding of consumer behavior  –  and a deep understanding of consumer behavior is the  underpinning of advantage in the marketplace for a firm. We see this cour se as an essential part of the  tool kit for a successful marketer and for a successful manager because a good understanding of neuro  principles enables a more proficient application of behavior change initiatives of different kinds  including marketing acti ons.  Required Materials 1. Course Pack of Readings and Cases Pedagogy o Case and Class Discussions For all classes and case discussions, it will be assumed that each participant has read and is fully  prepared to discuss the material and / or the case  in class. The objective is to understand and use the  data and information available in the reading materials and case  from a decision making standpoint  and to do the relevant analyses and make recommendations. Students should have read the material  which  in many instances are research papers and be prepared to discuss the readings in class.   o Lecture/Discussions These sessions will allow us to examine principles, models, theories, in consumer behavior  –  their  underlying neuro - scientific bases and their a pplication to marketing actions.  o Participant Limit . Participation will be limited to a total of 50 students (40 PGP,  5PGPX and  5 exchange). Evaluation Class Participation 20% Group Case write - ups (X1) 10% Synopsis of articles for the day  (X5 ) 1 5% Group Term Paper  5% + 15% + 5% Final Exam 30% o Class Participation:  Effective class participation requires good preparation and sharing your  thoughts in class with others in a manner that enhances the overall learning experience. You  will be  evaluated on the quality of your contribution. Participation that builds on the  discussion in the class tends to be the most effective.  Please be prepared to be cold called in the  class. If you do not want to be cold called in the class, you need to let me  know in advance so  alternative arrangements can be made. If you come to the class without preparation, you will  IIMA Confidential  –  please do not cite or quote without permission 3 not get credit for attendance.   A minimum attendance of 80% of the sessions is required – otherwise you will get an F on the course.  Class par ticipation which displays a lack of  preparation or is completely tangential to the discussion in class will get negative marks.  You  are required to have a name tag in front of you every single class day  –  this is mandatory.  The instructors reserve the righ t to change the weightage given to a particular session for  CP as required.  o Case Write - ups and Article Synopsis:  A three - page write - up of your analysis of a particular  aspect of assigned cases (or the articles assigned to you) discussed in the course is  required.  You will be assigned to groups at the beginning of the course and each  group will have a total  of  six assignments  across cases and articles.  These write - ups are due at the beginning of the  sessions .  Each case or article write - up should be NO MOR E than 3 type written pages  (excluding exhibits).  The assignment of the cases / articles will be done before the first  class day once the student list is available to the instructors. o Term Paper:  Each group will choose a topic in the area of consumer beh avior (preferably  around one of the sessions in the course) and provide  (a) a review of recent findings in the  area and (b) an evaluation of how 3 chosen applications of the concepts by marketers  –  one in  the Indian context and one in the US/UK context co nfirm or disconfirm the findings of the  research literature. You will submit your topic along with a brief note on the topic by the 5 th class day.  o All submissions will be accompanied by a TurnItIn Report. Any report with an overlap  of higher than 15% wil l be categorized as plagiarism and be considered an instance of  academic dishonesty.  o Academic Dishonesty:  Any instance of academic dishonesty will lead to an automatic F on  the course and a recommendation to the PGP EC and the Institute for expulsion fro m the  institute.  Note:  This is a research oriented course and there will be a premium on reading and understanding. It  is not for those who are looking for a light course. For those who are looking for the latest insights into  consumer behavior and  are willing to read, however, this is a highly recommended course. IIMA Confidential  –  please do not cite or quote without permission 4 IIMA Confidential  –  please do not cite or quote without permission 5 1 Course  Introduction In this session we will introduce the topic  of neuroscience and neuro - economics  as  well as discuss a model of consumer  decision making based  on the research of  Ramachandran and the book by Zweig that  will provide an overarching skein of ideas   and a background for the course. In this  session, we will describe the basic brain  structure and functions and the role of  conscious and unconscious in h uman and  consumer behavior. We will also discuss  the course as a whole and expectations for  the term.   Chapter 1 and 2 Zweig  Chapter 7 and 8 Ramachandran  2 Decision Making  and Neural  Correlates Consumer Decision Making models have  existed for more tha n 40 years beginning  from the Howard Sheth model to Petty and  Caccioppo and others. Recently,  researchers have begun investigating what  happens in the brain as it is making  decisions. This session explores how the  brain assigns “value” to a choice and to t he  interplay of emotion and cognition in the  decision making process and the role of  neurotransmitters like dopamine and  endorphins in arriving at and implementing  choice.

We shall discuss the use of knowledge  about consumer behavior for marketing  purposes  Prepar e Case : “Ikea Invades America” Recommended  Chapters 5 and 6 Zweig 4 Decision Making  Model s  and The  Role of  Confidence and  Risk In this session we will consider how  marketers may facilitate a shopping  experience by understanding customer  needs.  We will  relate the ideas of decision  making to brain processes from the  perspective of confidence and risk and the  fact that in decision making risk is not  evaluated cognitively only –  that there is a  strong affective component to the risk  – indeed that affect inf luences all decisions  and that there is no such thing as the  “rational economic man” much as the neo - classical economists would have us  believe.

We’ll consider  both how consumers perceive objects both  consciously and subliminally  –  including  the ide a of selective attention.  We’ll also  consider factors that influence attention         Required  \"Brain Rules:  Rule X  “The Brand - Ness of Strangers” in  The New  York Times ,  11/14/2008, by Rob Walker  Chapter 6 Ramachandran IIMA Confidential  –  please do not cite or quote without permission 6 with specific attention to the role of  language.

In this session we will  discuss three key elements that influence  consumer’s effort in decision making at  every stage in the process; motivation,  opportunity, and ability and how these are  influenced by the primal  instincts of greed  and fear. We will use a case example to  drive the discussion  –  Domex and the  Wadala experiment.

Everyone seems to  know that one “go to” person for  information about what to buy.  It turns out  these “go to” people may be very important  in the spr ead of information and product  adoption.  In this session we will discuss  theories of how information about products  are spread from one individual to the next  and how people choose who to rely on to  provide them with information and relate  these theories  to the mirror neuron system  in the brain.

For some,  buying a luxury car has been a decision  years in the making; endless consumer  magazines, showroom visits, discussions  with friends and neighbors, until finally, a  purchase is made. These high effort  decisions invo lve a great deal of  deliberation and may test the limits of our  cognitive abilities. However, the way  consumers evaluate options can be quite  different.  In this session we’ll discuss  some of the common decision ‘heuristics’  or ‘rules of thumb’ that consum ers use. We  will relate it to the neural correlates in the  decision making process.

In fact consumers make  lots of choices that they are not even aware  of making. In this session we will discuss  low involvement/ low effort decisions  including those governed by habits and  emotions that lead to simplifying heuristics         Require d   “Kenna's Dilema:  The Right  -  and Wrong  - Way to Ask People What they Want,\" in  Blink  by Malcolm Gladwell  “Why Did I Choose You?” in  Buyology  by  Martin Lindstrom  Hoyer and Brown (1990), “Brand Awareness  IIMA Confidential  –  please do not cite or quote without permission 7 and Choice of a Repeat Purchase Product,”  Journal  of Consumer Research  10 Information  Search and  Prediction To achieve their goals and to evaluate  alternatives consumers search for  information both internally by relying on  their memory, and externally, by seeking  out sources of information. We’ll disc uss  these processes in session 8 and consider  how information search leads to predictions  and how these influence the choices  consumers make.       Required  Kahneman and Tversky (1973), “ on the  Psychology of Prediction,”  Psychological  Review , 80, 237 - 251.  Chapter 4 Zweig 11 Learning and  Hypothesis  Testing Part of evaluation involves forming  inferences and relying on stored  knowledge.  But just how do consumers  learn?  How do they form inferences about  the relationships between brands and  quality, f or example?  How do they test  hypotheses to build their knowledge?  In  session 9 we will discuss some important  elements of how consumers learn that can  influence how they ultimately make choices  –  including the influence of dopamine  levels in the brain on  the learning and  reward process.

Unfortunately, not everything we  experience is stored in memory, and a  substantial part of a retrieved memory is  actually reconstructed with influence of the  present context and situation.  So  understanding the basics of memory is  important for unde rstanding consumer  behavior. We will look at some of the  underlying neurological bases of memory  and knowledge and the marketing  implications, thereof.

Attitudes can  influence how consumers  think, how they  feel, and what they do.  In this session we’ll  discuss attitudes and how they are formed,  and changed. We will use a case to  illustrate the idea that because conditioned  brand attitudes do not change easily, one  tactic that can be employed  by a firm is to  minimize the change in a rebranding effort.

The study of  these shortcuts, referred to as heuristics and  biases, has increased in recent years with a  growing interest in beha vioral economics.

This goes for  decisions too.  Many studies have shown  the influence of how the choice is  described, how other available options,  and  even how seeming irrelevant information  can play an important role in how products  are evaluated.  In this session we will  discuss many of these factors that influence  consumer decision making  –  including the  neural basis of framing that ties to the  le vels of dopamine in the brain.

It  is  closer  to  the  business  economics.  Transfer pricing closely follows business decisions and intentions underlying  an inter - division  or  inter - company  transaction.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  understand  the  business  rationale  and  relevant  facts  and  circumstances  while  analysing  the  transfer  prices adopted for  such transactions. In  globalised  environments,  cross - border transactions  are  increasing  in  number  and  complexity and transfer pricing outcomes need to  be  in line with business value creation.  The subject of transfer pricing has become the centre of a new public controversy . T he  issue  is whether the current rules p ermit multinational entities to pay less than their ‘fair  share’ of the overall tax burden in some of the territories in which they operate . Therefore the  consequence is s ignificant increase in transfer pricing disputes and a global focus on  base erosion a nd profit shifting. India introduced detailed transfer pricing regulations in 2001 and since then India has  been no exception to the above development cycle as experienced by other countries; we  have been experiencing our own set of issues through the tria l and error method of  i mplementing these regulations, both from the tax authority as well as the taxpayer  perspective. Transfer  Pricing  is  thus  one  of  the  important  agenda  items  in  the  board  room  of  multinational Companies and hence critical as part of the MBA curriculum.  Course Objective Upon completion of the  Course , learners will be able to:  Explain the concept of Transfer Pricing; and  Understand the importance of Transfer Pricing in current economic scenario of  globalisation  Pedagogy Most of the sessi ons shall be taught through discussions, based on the assigned readings,  supplemented by lectures  and case studies.

This has resulted into countries wanting to  identify and retain a fair share of  t axes, for the opportunity provided to the  Global  business  t o  exploit  its  resources.  Further,  the  m ultinational  organisations  are  operating  in  an  environment  of  unprecedented  change.  There is a surge in volume and complexity of intercompany transactions. As  a result, International Tax and Transfer pricing become an integral part of  business in an evolving business environment. 2 The Arm’s Length Principle Interpretation of the arm’s length principle  - “arm’s length price” means a price which is applied or proposed to be applied  in  a  transaction  between  persons  other  than  associated  enterprises,  in  uncontrolled conditions; Associated enterprises  – The  relationship  of  \"Associated  Enterprises\"  means  direct/  indirect  participation  in  the  management,  control  or  capital  of  an  enterprise  by  another enterprise. It al so covers situations where the same person (directly  or indirectly) participates in the management, control or capital of both the  enterprises.

There appears to be a high degree of  willingness, within companies,  to adapt and adopt to  changing pattern s of co mmunication and  explore techniques of improving interactivity with consumers and stakeholders.  While there are  differential levels of readiness and social media maturity  in compa nies there is overall agreement  that  today,  social media is the key mantra for building and managing reputation. The point gains  credence when we assess it in terms of Buffet’s (2013) statement that   \"It takes 20 years to  build a reputation and five  minutes to ruin it . ” Can social media , then, be used to manage reputation? What  are  the  social media  tools and techniques adopted by companies  to manage reputation which is fragile and difficult to form, develop, a nd maintain? The emergence of new and social media such as Facebook, T witter, YouTube, etc. presents both  opportunities and  challenges for  reputation management.  On the one hand, the new media  environment is purported to provide reputational benefits by making corporations more transparent,  providing the opportunity to seek and provide feedback, and to engage stakeholders in di alogue and  conversation; on the other, new and social media present reputational risks as they provide new  opportunities to create or escalate crises (even hoaxes) and facilitate digital activism against  business practices.  What then, are the attendant imp lications? The focus of the course is on examining some of these questions  while  study ing the impact of social  media on corporate reputation. Objectives 1.

This is not a pure law class, it has  ingredients of strategy, economics, finance, capital markets operations backed up with  several high profile cases and real life situations. Course  Objectives  To introduce you to the application of regulations in the capital and financial markets.  You will notice how the subject impacts the daily lives of bankers, investment  advisors, finance professionals and senior managers who must oversee corporat e  finance decisions. The importance of the course would be in helping future corporate  leaders avoid the pitfalls faced by their predecessors  – ignorance of the law is no  excuse for violating it.  As a senior manager, you will be responsible for the action  of all your subordinates  and it is important to have internal controls in place so that you don’t get into trouble  for the sins of others. Knowing the regulations will help you structure prophylactic  internal controls.  As a deal maker and negotiator in the corporate world, knowing what to put in a  shareholders’ agreement or any agreement for that matter will place you ahead of  your colleagues in hard usable skills on a daily basis.  To introduce you to legal strategy. Several successful businessmen have used the law  and the courts as a sword and a shield in corporate disputes, in particular, takeover  issues. The law is indeed a powerful weapon in the highly regulated field of securities  and financial regulations. You will also be exposed to people who use the law and  legal remedies to their strategic advantage.   The course will show you how exciting legal issues and battles can be. You will be  introduced to a few of the biggest financial scamsters, insider traders and fraudulent  people in history and their mod us operandi (Charles Ponzi and Ivan Boesky for  instance) and their sometimes successful legal defenses. You will also see some of the  largest Indian scams play out in the Indian system. You will see how much they got  away with and how effective (really) ar e the regulations in curbing fraud,  manipulation and insider trading. Throughout the course you will be exposed to US regulations. In particular the law on insider  trading and fraud is very highly developed in that country and will be used for filling up  holes  in the understanding of Indian regulations.  Pedagogy This session uses the ‘case law’ method of teaching  – which is different from the case method  used at the institute. This method uses primary material from actual cases from courts. From  the prev ious years’ classes the students have found the reading material a little difficult  initially because of the legal jargon but it did not seem to be a problem during the latter half  of the class as people started getting used to the ‘case law’ method and th e legal language. Readings from the “course material” must be read  before class. Everything in the course  material and what is discussed in class is game for grading. Optional readings will be handed  out by way of a small compilation. Optional readings ar e not used for grading purposes but  are highly recommended for your future professional use. There will be marks for class  participation, so read up before you participate. If for some reason you are unable to read  before class please intimate me before cl ass. Number of sessions. 15 sessions.  Evaluation criteria and Grading To a person who has not taken the course, the amount of work may seem excessive  – however as you will see during the course, most of the grade based work that you do is not  excessive  and the exams are practical and fun. Exams : There will be one objective type exam worth 75% at the end of the course.  Class participation: 25% is reserved for class participation. If you have a conflict with an  important engagement you must inform me befo re the beginning of the class either in person  or by email to escape penalty. Rules of Engagement for exam  Honour code : For the exam, the statute book will be made available i.e. the written  law  – there is no requirement to memorize anything learnt.   May  the curve be with you! Relationship of the course with the overall programme objective and related courses The course builds upon the basics of finance and market structure learnt in the core finance  courses. As regulation is a key part of finance, and in creasingly so, this course prepares the  student to work in an environment where he will be faced with regulatory issues.  Strongly Recommended courses : Finance I and II. You should refresh your memory regarding basic concepts of time value of  money, the e fficient capital market hypothesis (you are requested to look up the basic concept  of the weak, semi - strong and strong forms  – you will hear the phrase ECMH  ad nauseam  in  this class), the CAPM and some basics of valuation.

Semiotics  is a field of study involving many different theoretical  stances and methodological tools. Semiotics involves the study not only of what we refer to as 'signs' in  everyday speech, but of anything which 'stands for' s omething else. In a semiotic sense, signs take the  form of words, images, sounds, gestures and objects. Whilst for the linguist Saussure, 'semiology' was 'a  science which studies the role of signs as part of social life', for the philosopher Charles Peirce 'semiotic'  was the 'formal doctrine of signs' which was closely related to Logic . Contemporary semioticians study  signs not in isolation but as part of semiotic 'sign systems' (such as a medium or genre). They study  how meanings are made: as such, being c oncerned not only with communication but also with the  construction  and maintenance of  reality. Semiotics  represents  a  range of  studies  in  art,  literature,  anthropology  and  the  mass  media  rather  than  an  independent  academic  discipline. Semiotics  is  importa nt because it deals with two important aspects of human life  – reality as a system of signs  (reality is constructed and we have a role to play in it as we interpret it) and Meaning as actively created  according to a complex interplay of codes or convention s that is usually taken for granted. Meaning, is  not  readily  available  to  us  and  to  understand  how  it  comes  to  us  through  constructed  codes  is  intellectually empowering as we begin to understand how to deconstruct different realities in human  life.  Semiot ics and marketing communications Brands create value for themselves from the meanings and symbolic relationship that is forged between  them and their consumers. Purchase decisions are made when consumers see meaning in brands and a  lot has been written about the impact of brand meaning on market value. Semiotics as a discipline  engages  with  the  production  and  circulation  of  meaning  and  in  its  applied  form  to  marketing  communications in the last three decades has proven to be o f immense value as a method of analysis  and also as a method that can help refocus and reposition brands in the future. Practitioners have  demonstrated the use of semiotics to the full spectrum of brand manage ment that includes: - research,  market  segmentat ion,  brand  positioning,  creative  strategy  and  the  design  of  products,  packaging, and retail sites Course Objectives:  This course will take students through the basics of Semiotic theories, concepts and research methods  with a view to apply the same to  pra ctices in media and the marketing discourses The aim is twofold:  T o understand the value of semiotics as an interpretative method  To see its value when used in the planning process that can help strengthe n the symbolic value  of brand communications and th e media Course Sessions Session 1: Introduction to Semiotics - the philosophical foundations Readings:  Danesi,  Marcel  (1994a): Messages  and  Meanings:  An  Introduction  to  Semiotics .

Appendix  - Session Plan A. World Economy and Society Class # 1 : The Defining Moments of the World Economy Case: Perspectives on the Great Depression vis - à - vis 2008 Great Moderation The Great Depression was, by far, the worst economic contraction in the XXth century and some  of the most important ideas about both fiscal and monetary policy in the second part of the  century were developed in response to the Depression. What were the basic perspectives on both  the causes and possible cures of the Depression? How was it different in 2008? Questions 1.  What  aspects  of  Keynes’  diagnosis  and  proposed  cures  seem  most  compelling?  Most  troubling? 2. What aspects of Friedmand and Schwartz’s analysis seem most compelling? Most troubling? 3. Do Keynes and Roosevelt essentially agree? 4. Juxtapose Great Depression vis - à - vis 2008 Great Moderation Class #2:  P opulation growth, aging, migration, and urb anization Case: Demographic Upheaval (Finance and Development March 2016  - IMF),  Humankind is being buffeted by the forces of demographic change. The most prominent changes  are rapid population growth in some developing economies and shifting shares of  adolescents  and young adults in others, increasing longevity and population aging throughout the world, and  urbanization and international migration. All pose formidable challenges — threatening economic  growth, fiscal stability, environmental quality, and h uman security and welfare. Questions 1. Ninety - nine percent of projected population growth over the next four decades will occur in  countries that are classified as less developed — Africa, Asia (excluding Japan), Latin America  and  the  Caribbean,  Melanesia,  Micronesia,  and  Polynesia. How  to  provide  jobs  for  large  n umbers of people and give them the human capital (quality education, training, and health) they  need to be productive? 2. What are the fiscal consequences of shrinking and aging populati ons? 3. Where will they live? 4. What are the major policy reforms in the way forward? B .  Advanced Economies Class # 3: Countries with Negative Inflation and Growth Case  - Japan: Betting on Inflation?  The case describes the ʺthree arrowsʺ of  Abenomics, the economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and their implementation in the first year of his administration. The ʺfirst arrowʺ  consists of a monetary policy whose aim is to raise the inflation rate to 2%, its ʺsecond arrowʺ  involves a s hort run expansion and longer run contraction of fiscal policy while the ʺthird arrowʺ  is designed to transform the structure of the Japanese economy.  Questions 1. Was Abe right that Japan faced a deflation crisis when he took office? 2. What are the s trengths and weaknesses of Governor Kuroda’s approach to monetary policy? 3. Should Japan be happy or worried about the low level of JGB yields? 4. Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future of trade and investment flows in the region? Class # 4: The Growth Illusion:  Loose Monetary Policy in the US and Europe (Case to be prepared) Class # 5 : The Crisis on the Continent: Greece Case: The Greek Crisis: Tragedy or Opportunity  - How Government Debt Accumulates After its 2009 ‐ 10 fiscal crisis shook  the euro, could the Greek government’s efforts to stabilize  debt, avoid default, and stay on the euro succeed? This case looks at the Greek social and  political road to fiscal crisis; the economics of that crisis and efforts to recover from it; the  danger  the  crisis  posed  to  the  euro;  cooperation  and  conflict  among  European  states,  the  European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund to try to help Greece emerge from  crisis; and the role financial markets played in these events. Questions 1. Wha t do you see as the main sources of the Greek crisis? 2. Evaluate the domestic and international response to the crisis. Did being in the euro help or  hurt? 3. How do you judge the scenarios from here? Can Greece make it?  C  .  The Crack in the BRICS  (without India) Class # 6 : Waxing and Waning of Brazil In the past few years Brazil’s economy has disappointed. It grew by 2.2% a year, on average, a  slower rate of growth than in most of its neighbours, let alone in places like China or India. Last  year  GDP shriveled by 3.8%, and is expected to shrink by a similar amount in 2015. Household  consumption has registered the first drop, year - on - year, since Ms Rousseff’s left - wing Workers’  Party (PT) came to power in 2003. At the same time, public spending has  surged. In 2014, as Ms  Rousseff sought re - election, the budget deficit doubled to 6.75% of GDP; it has since swelled by  another four percentage points. This year is likely to be the third in a row when the government  fails to set aside any money to pay bac k creditors: the target for the primary surplus, which  excludes interest owed on debt, has been cut from an unambitious 0.5% to basically nought, and  the government is trying to leave itself room to post another primary deficit. Brazil’s gross  government d ebt of 70% may look piffling compared to Greece’s 197% or Japan’s 246%. But its  high interest rates of around 14% make borrowing costlier to service. Debt payments eat up more  than 8% of output. To let businesses and consumers borrow at less exorbitant rat es, public banks  have increasingly filled the gap, offering cheap, subsidised loans. These went from 40% of all  lending in 2010 to 55%. Questions 1. Has Brazil lost out its place in BRICS? 2.  Are the policies of President Dilma Rousseff’s first term in office in 2011 - 14 responsible for  this dismal performance? 3. What are the policy options? There is an excellent case material on this subject available in December 1, 2015 Economist:  http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/12/economic - backgr ounder  Class # 7 : 1998 Crisis of Russia and its transformation  Case  - Russia: Revolution and Reform The collapse of central authority in the Soviet Union in 1991 ushered in a period of revolutionary  transformations for the states that emerged from the union. The leaders of Russia, the USSR’s  successor, since then have struggled to reestablish central authority, while at the same time trying  to keep the country from further disintegration, establish a democratic polity, and institute a  market economy. T he case contrasts different approaches adopted by Presidents Boris Yeltsin  and Vladimir Putin and concludes with a vision outlined by Russia’s third post ‐ Soviet president,  Dmitry  Medvedev.  The  case  focuses  on  problems  of  state  authority;  fiscal  capacity;  i nstitutionalization  of  political  parties;  relations  between  the  federal  center  and  provincial  governments; relations between the state and big business; economic policy; and models of  economic development. Questions 1. Compare the crises of 1998 and  2008. How were they similar? How were they different? 2. Is Russia in 2010 still vulnerable to political and economic instability? Class # 8 : The Political Economy and Reform in China  Cases: China: “To Get Rich is Glorious” and The “Chongqing Model” and the Future of China When Deng Xiaoping acceded to power in 1978, China was exceedingly poor and exhausted by  a decade of Cultural Revolution. In less than two decades, however, China’s economy had grown  by a factor of 30. Its exports, now 21% of GDP, wer e beginning to flood world markets. Parts of  China’s development strategy had become a model for other, less ‐ developed countries. 1. What was Deng’s development strategy between 1978 and 1997? How well did it work? 2. What are the most serious problems fa cing Jiang Zemin in 1997? 3. As of 1997, what role did foreign direct investment play in China’s development? In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, dwindling Chinese exports, increasing corruption,  and  widening  inequalities,  many  in  China  feare d  that  the  model  of  development  that  had  propelled  the  country  to  become  the  second  largest  economy  in  the  world  was  due  for  adjustment. The Chinese Communist Party, anticipating what they hoped would be the second  ever peaceful leadership transition in th e fall of 2012, was eager for policies that would maintain  economic growth and social stability. At the same time, between 2007 and 2012, the provincial  municipality of Chongqing in the southwest became China’s fastest growing city, averaging over  15% GDP  growth per annum. Chongqing’s growth was the result of a suite of policies that had  been designated as the “Chongqing Model,” a bundle of social and economic reforms that  promised public and private sector growth with benefits more equitably shared by all. When the  city’s leader, Bo Xilai, was publicly dismissed following a murder scandal, the region’s new  leaders — and indeed China’s new leaders — had to decide: should elements of the model be  adopted elsewhere, or should Bo’s fall also spell the end of the Ch ongqing Model? Questions 1. How did Chongqing grow so dramatically between 2007 and 2012? Is this sustainable? 2. Does China need a new model? If so, which should they adopt: Guangdong or Chongqing? Class # 9 : The Devaluation of Renminbi and Fallout   (Case to be prepared) Class # 10 : Health, Unemployment and Growth  – Case of South Africa (Case to be prepared) Life expectancy, after falling dramatically from 62 years in 1992 to 53 years in 2010, recovered  to 62 years in 2014 . The recent recovery was in large part due to the rapid expansion of the  antiretroviral treatment programs to fight HIV/AIDS. And it is supported by declines in both  adult  and  infant  mortality.  The  poor  are  particularly  vulnerable,  and  high  HIV  and  AIDS  i nfection rates, as well as TB infections, have severely strained the health system, contributing to  the poor health indicators South Africa’s growth is stuck in low gear with real GDP growth estimated at 2.0% and the same  for 2016 due to a combination of  domestic constrains and external headwinds arising from the  fall in commodity prices and slowdown of the Chinese economy.  The weak growth performance  has exacerbated already high unemployment, inequality, and macro vulnerabilities. However, a  slight recov ery is expected in 2017 with real GDP growth estimated at 2.4% as new electricity  supply comes on line. Questions 1. What are the policy options to revive and employment situation in South Africa? 2. How to deal with health related issues primarily  coming from HIV/AIDS? D .  Growth and Development Class # 11 : Growth and Development: The case of Singapore Case  – Singapore By 2013, Singapore had recovered nicely from the financial crisis. It’s GDP per capital, which  had stood at $427 less than 50 year s ago, now exceeded $51,000, making Singapore one of the  world’s richest countries. But an array of new challenges at home and abroad, now seemed to  engender slower growth and a variety of difficulties to come. Thus, Prime Minister Lee Hsien  Loong  appointe d  an  Economic  Strategies  Committee  to  assess  these  issues  and  propose  necessary changes. The new strategy is focused on skills development, productivity growth and  becoming a hub for Asia. Yet how would Singapore cope with its low fertility rate, aging  pop ulation and an immigrant population of more than one ‐ third? Questions 1. How did Singapore achieve extremely high economic growth rates after 1965? 2. How has productivity growth been attained, and how can it be sustained? 3. What is your evaluation of Lee Hsien Loong’s new strategy? Will it work? Class #1 2 : The Developmental State Korea Case  - Korea In the 66 years from its founding in 1948, South Korea transformed itself from an impoverished, agrarian  nation  into  a  hypermodern  and  prosperous  societ y.  Authoritarian  governmental  structures  gave  way  to  democracy,  even  as  old ‐ fashioned  corporate  governance  structures  persisted.  Yet,  with  an  aging  population,  and  the  totalitarian  North  Korean  government  continuing to pursue its nuclear ambitions, past  successes were no guarantee for the future. Questions 1. How did South Korea become rich? What role, if any, did democratization play? 2. Can South Korea continue to grow? 3. Do the chaebols need to be reformed? If so, how? Can they reform themselves? 4. Is reunification with the North inevitable? Is it desirable? Class #13: Capital and Control Case Malaysia: Capital and Control On September 1, 1998, the government of Malaysia imposed currency and capital controls in response  to  the  financial  crisis  that  had  swept  Asia.  The  controls  sparked  an  enormous controversy in the world of international finance. Some celebrated the controls for insulating the Malaysian  economy  from  the  unstable  international  financial  system.  Others  criticized  the contro ls for trapping investors and allowing the government to protect the interests of ʺcronies.ʺ This  debate  also  raised  the  central  question  about  the  future  of  the  international  financial architecture: What is the appropriate balance between financial market freedom and government  discretion in the management of the global economy? Questions 1. What caused the financial crisis in Malaysia? 2. Why did the Malaysian government impose currency and capital controls? What were the benefits and costs? 3. What a re the lessons of Malaysia’s experiment with currency and capital controls? E .  Natural Resources, Policies and Development Class #1 4 : Natural Resources,  National Policy and the Global Economy Case: Chileʹs Copper Surplus: The Road Not Taken In 2008, Andres Velasco, Chileʹs Finance Minister, faced mounting criticisms over his fiscal  policy. As the worldʹs largest copper producer, Chile was benefitting from the rise in copper  prices, which had more than tripled since 2003. Copper revenues trans lated into greater income  for the government as Chileʹs biggest copper producer, Codelco, was a state ‐ owned enterprise.  Velasco had chosen to save the bulk of the copper revenues into two stabilization funds; by the  end of August 2008, the collective amoun t represented more than 20% of Chileʹs GDP. Several  critics wanted the funds to be used to improve the poor public education system, income gap, and  other impending social issues. After all, Chile had one of the most unequal distributions of  wealth  in  the  world.  Productivity  was  stagnant,  and  economic  growth  had  slowed  down  significantly since the 1990s. What should Velasco do amid growing public discontent? Was it  really in Chileʹs best interest to keep saving the copper wealth? Questions 1. Why did  Chile adopt the stabilization policy? 2. What are the arguments for and against using the stabilization money in 2008 (before the fall  of Lehman)? 3. What are the pros and cons for the international financial architecture of having governments  establish  stabilization funds? Class # 15 : Natural Resources and Development Case Nigeria: Opportunity in Crisis?  This case explores Nigeria’s economic position and growth strategy in the face of the 2008  global crisis. The principal objectives are to understand  why such a resource ‐ rich country has  failed to thrive, to examine what the crisis might mean for Nigeria’s reforms and efforts to attract  outside  investment,  and  to  explore  the  economic  and  political  uncertainty  created  by  the  plummeting price of oil, the  country’s main export. Questions 1. What should the Nigerian government do in response to the global financial crisis? 2. How would you rate the NEEDS reforms? What should be done next? 3. What accounts for Nigeriaʹs economic stagnation between 1966 an d 2003? What could be  done to prevent history from repeating itself? Class #1 6 : Globalization and Modernization in the Middle East  (Or  the Politics of Oil - there is a nice and long case - size article called ‘ The oil conundrum’ in  the Economist in Jan 23 , 2016 ) Case  - Saudi Arabia: Finding Stability after the Arab Spring Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah has problems  – both domestic and foreign. Domestically, he  needs to build the country’s economy to accommodate a “youth bulge,” balancing between  liberals  and religious conservatives. And he needs to diversify the economy away from its  reliance on oil. Internationally, he must cope with the Arab Spring, with war in Syria, the threat  from Iran and continuing friction between Palestinians and Israelis. Questi ons 1. Has oil been a blessing or a curse for Saudi Arabia? 2. What is Abdullah’s strategy for economic development? 3. How is Abdullah coping with the Arab Spring? F. Policies and Issues in Other Countries Class #17: Investing in Human Capital: The Case of Sri Lanka (There is a nice World Bank 2014 research report on the same  – it is better than a case) Sri Lanka has done well in promoting access to primary and secondary education through a long  history of public sector provision. Participation r ates are high and equitable among gender,  regional and economic categories. Learning outcomes in primary and secondary education have  also been increasing, albeit from a low level. The internal efficiency of primary and secondary  education is strong, and t his has enabled the country to support a high level of participation on a  relatively low public education budget. Higher education enrolment has also been rising over  time.  Questions 1.  How has Sri Lanka achieved success in improving educational attain ment in the country? 2. What is the role of public and private investment in education in Sri Lanka? 3. What is the return on investment in secondary education and higher education in Sri Lanka? Class #18: Hyperinflation to Deflation  Case: Curious  Case of Zimbabwe Zimbabwe’s decision to scrap the local currency in 2009 helped end hyperinflation as it cut off  the government’s ability to print money to pay debts. At the same time, it eroded manufacturers’  competitiveness by making it cheaper to impor t everything from food to clothing rather than  produce them in a country suffering from a lack of cash, power shortages and high costs.  Zimbabwe  is  caught  up  in  a  spiral  of  stagnating  growth,  rising  unemployment  and  now,  worsening deflation. Consumer price s have fallen every month since March 2014, dropping 2.8  percent in July from a year ago. That’s a far cry from the days when prices rose an average of  500 billion percent at their peak in 2008, according to estimates from the International Monetary  Fund. Questions 1.  Was scrapping the local currency the optimal solution? 2.  What are the options available against spiral of slowing growth, rising unemployment and  falling prices? 3 . How to revive an economy when its capacity utilization in manufacturing d rops to 39%? (A  nice  case  is  available  at  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015 - 09 - 02/from - hyperinflation - to - deflation - no - end - to - zimbabwe - s - decline ) Class #19:  Welfare State and the Swedish Model (Case:  The Swedish Model :  Conflict or Consensus? (HÅKAN A BENGTSSON: International  Policy Anal ysis, November 2013) W hy  the  Nordic  countries  prosper  despite  being  high  tax  states  and  yet  there  is  business  dynamism and innovation. These are also states with labour market regulation and yet they have  managed to provide high standards of living.  I n a world of globalization with corporations  shifting headquarters where tax rates are low the survival of the welfare state and issues of fiscal  politics is something worth focusing on.  Questions 1 .  Is the Swedish model under stress ? Welfare planning t o welfare market  – Swedish model  redefined? 2.  Is there labor market polarization or upskilling? 3. The future o f the social insurance system  - basic security or loss of income? Class #20: Gains from Trade: Success Story of Bangladesh Case: Bangladesh beats China in Garment exports  In the past decade, Bangladesh’s production share of the world’s cheap clothing has skyrocketed.  In 2013, Bangladesh exported nearly $31 billion of goods overall — nearly twice what it did just  four years ear lier in 2009 — according to data from the International Trade Centre . About 90% of  that  value,  some  $28  billion,  came  from  clothes.  It  is  the  world’s  second - largest  garment  export er, and its share of the global closet just keeps growing. It is believed that Bangladesh rose  to its position largely because of its lack of regulation and the low wages it pays its garment  workers, most of whom are women. Questions 1. How Bangladesh be came an increasingly attractive place to make clothes on the cheap? 2.  Are lax regulations a better alternative to  improve  export? 3. What are the inherent problem s of the Bangladesh ’s garment export model? A nice case is  available at:  http://qz.com/389741/the - thing - that - makes - bangladeshs - garment - industry - such - a - huge - success - also - makes - it - deadly/","pdf":"term-6/World-Economy-in-the-Course.pdf","summary":"There will be minimum three evaluation components for any core or  elective course having credit of 1 or more. x.
